Its slow movement produced prolonged rainfall exceeding 350 mm within 24 hours in some areas, and the rainy conditions continued for four consecutive days, resulting in catastrophic flooding, slope failures, and extensive damage to homes, infrastructure, and livelihoods, making it one of the worst disasters in decades. Although intense rainfall has eased in many districts since 29 November, flooding continues to worsen in several low-lying and downstream areas due to sustained high river discharge, overflow of river basins, and delayed downstream flow even after the rains have subsided. The Department of Irrigation has extended flood warnings for the next 48 hours for the Kelani and Mahaweli River basins, noting that water levels are still rising despite reduced rainfall, while the Meteorology Department has cautioned that runoff from saturated highland catchments will continue moving downstream, prolonging inundation in vulnerable areas.",

The storm's slow pace led to over 350 mm of rain in some regions within 24 hours. \u2022 Although rainfall has subsided, flooding persists in low-lying and downstream areas due to sustained high river discharge, overflow of river basins, and delayed downstream flow. Situation update \u2022 Despite a significant reduction in rainfall across the island, the Irrigation Department issued flood warnings cautioning residents living in surrounding areas to remain alert. On 1 December, flood warnings were extended for the Malwathu Oya and Mahaweli River basins, while the water levels in the Kelani river are receding. Residents in landslide-prone hilly areas were cautioned to remain vigilant for signs of slope instability, rock falls, and earth slips. \u2022 Markets across the island are heavily impacted, resulting in steep price increases (from 20 to 200 percent) for certain vegetables, largely due to the shortage in supply.

Average rainfall forecast for next seven days suggest average conditions. Below-average rainfall after hurricane Melissa over Haiti Hurricane Melissa brought catastrophic impacts to Haiti in late October, resulting in fatalities and significant damage to infrastructure and cropland. The highest rainfall totals\u2014exceeding 300 percent of the historical average\u2014were reported in Grand'Anse, Sud, Nippes, Sud-Est, Ouest, and L'Artibonite. Over a five-day period, rainfall surpassed 400 mm. The accompanying gusty winds, flooding, and landslides damaged irrigation systems, which could pose a challenge for farmers in the upcoming planting seasons. Since the beginning of November, rainfall has been sporadic and light. This has aided the drainage of flooded areas, replenished water storage in reservoirs, and facilitated crop activity in areas where irrigation systems were not severely affected. As shown in Figure 1, rainfall across most of Haiti for the period of November 11-20 did not exceed 30 percent of the usual amounts, which supports recovery efforts and crop development. Additionally, observed high temperatures are directly related to above-average evapotranspiration rates. The rainfall forecast for next seven days (Figure 2) indicates average conditions for Haiti. This is favorable for agricultural activities and allows for the utilization of excess rainfall following Hurricane Melissa. Temperatures are expected to be slightly above-average, providing some relief to communities engaged in rebuilding infrastructure and production systems.",

Cameroon\u2019s humanitarian needs intensified in October as insecurity in the North West, South West, and Far North regions, combined with country-wide lockdowns following the post-electoral crisis, severely restricted movement and access to services. These disruptions limited gender-based violence (GBV) case management, psychosocial support, and antenatal and prenatal care, while also constraining the deployment of integrated mobile clinics. The broader instability has degraded civilian safety and heightened protection risks for women and girls. Despite these constraints, UNFPA and partners sustained essential sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and GBV services. Nearly 6,000 pregnant women accessed antenatal care, over 2,100 facility-based deliveries were supported \u2014 including 142 life-saving caesarean sections \u2014 and 8,304 people were reached with GBV and SRH awareness campaigns. Almost all GBV survivors received case management, and close to 2,800 women and girls engaged in psychosocial support and skills-building activities, while youth dialogues and community preparedness sessions strengthened social cohesion and resilience. However, critical funding gaps threaten the continuity of these services. As of October, only US$3.5 million of the US$9 million required had been secured, leaving a 61 percent shortfall. This lack of resources directly compromises access to life-saving SRH and GBV assistance and places thousands of vulnerable women and girls at heightened risk, particularly in areas affected by conflict, displacement, and climate shocks.",

These overlapping pressures significantly heightened the vulnerability of civilians, especially women and girls. Despite these constraints, UNFPA sustained critical sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and gender-based violence (GBV) services through community midwives, mobile teams, safe spaces, and One Stop Centers. These efforts ensured access to antenatal and postnatal care, assisted deliveries, family planning, psychosocial support, and survivor-centered GBV services, reaching thousands of people even as electricity cuts, mobility restrictions, and suspended activities limited coverage in several areas.
