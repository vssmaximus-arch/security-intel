    "snippet": "CISA is aware of multiple cyber threat actors actively leveraging commercial spyware to target users of mobile messaging applications (apps). 1 These cyber actors use sophisticated targeting and social engineering techniques to deliver spyware and gain unauthorized access to a victim\u2019s messaging app, facilitating the deployment of additional malicious payloads that can further compromise the victim\u2019s mobile device. These cyber actors use tactics such as: Phishing and malicious device-linking QR codes to compromise victim accounts and link them to actor-controlled devices. Zero-click exploits, 2 which require no direct action from the device user. Impersonation 3 of messaging app platforms, such as Signal and WhatsApp. While current targeting remains opportunistic, evidence suggests these cyber actors focus on high-value individuals, such as current and former high-ranking government, military, and political officials, 4 as well as civil society organizations (CSOs) and individuals across the United States, 5 Middle East, 6 and Europe. 7 CISA strongly encourages messaging app users to review the updated Mobile Communications Best Practice Guidance and Mitigating Cyber Threats with Limited Resources: Guidance for Civil Society for steps to protect mobile communications and messaging apps, as well as mitigations against spyware.
