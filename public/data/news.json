EXECUTIVE SUMMARY CVSS v4 8.7 ATTENTION : Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity Vendor : Mirion Medical Equipment : EC2 Software NMIS BioDose Vulnerabilities : Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, Use of Client-Side Authentication, Use of Hard-coded Credentials 2. RISK EVALUATION Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to modify program executables, gain access to sensitive information, gain unauthorized access to the application, and execute arbitrary code. 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following Mirion Medical products are affected: EC2 Software NMIS BioDose: Versions prior to 23.0 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW 3.2.1 INCORRECT PERMISSION ASSIGNMENT FOR CRITICAL RESOURCE CWE-732 NMIS/BioDose V22.02 and previous versions' installation directory paths by default have insecure file permissions, which in certain deployment scenarios can enable users on client workstations to modify the program executables and libraries. CVE-2025-64642 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H ). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2025-64642 . A base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N ). 3.2.2 INCORRECT PERMISSION ASSIGNMENT FOR CRITICAL RESOURCE CWE-732 NMIS/BioDose V22.02 and previous version installations where the embedded Microsoft SQLServer Express is used are exposed in the Windows share accessed by clients in networked installs. By default, this directory has insecure directory paths that allow access to the SQL Server database and configuration files, which can contain sensitive data. CVE-2025-64298 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H ). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2025-64298 . A base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N ). 3.2.3 USE OF CLIENT-SIDE AUTHENTICATION CWE-603 NMIS/BioDose V22.02 and previous versions rely on a common SQL Server user account to access data in the database. User access in the client application is restricted by a password authentication check in the client software but the underlying database connection always has access. The latest version of NMIS/BioDose introduces an option to use Windows user authentication with the database, which would restrict this database connection. CVE-2025-61940 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L ). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2025-61940 . A base score of 8.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N ). 3.2.4 USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798 NMIS/BioDose software V22.02 and previous versions contain executable binaries with plain text hard-coded passwords. These hard-coded passwords could allow unauthorized access to both the application and database. CVE-2025-64778 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L ). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2025-64778 . A base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N ). 3.2.5 INCORRECT PERMISSION ASSIGNMENT FOR CRITICAL RESOURCE CWE-732 NMIS/BioDose V22.02 and previous versions rely on a Microsoft SQL Server database. The SQL user account 'nmdbuser' and other created accounts by default have the sysadmin role. This can lead to remote code execution through the use of certain built-in stored procedures. CVE-2025-62575 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L ). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2025-62575 .

    "snippet": "CISA is aware of multiple cyber threat actors actively leveraging commercial spyware to target users of mobile messaging applications (apps). 1 These cyber actors use sophisticated targeting and social engineering techniques to deliver spyware and gain unauthorized access to a victim\u2019s messaging app, facilitating the deployment of additional malicious payloads that can further compromise the victim\u2019s mobile device. These cyber actors use tactics such as: Phishing and malicious device-linking QR codes to compromise victim accounts and link them to actor-controlled devices. Zero-click exploits, 2 which require no direct action from the device user. Impersonation 3 of messaging app platforms, such as Signal and WhatsApp. While current targeting remains opportunistic, evidence suggests these cyber actors focus on high-value individuals, such as current and former high-ranking government, military, and political officials, 4 as well as civil society organizations (CSOs) and individuals across the United States, 5 Middle East, 6 and Europe. 7 CISA strongly encourages messaging app users to review the updated Mobile Communications Best Practice Guidance and Mitigating Cyber Threats with Limited Resources: Guidance for Civil Society for steps to protect mobile communications and messaging apps, as well as mitigations against spyware.
