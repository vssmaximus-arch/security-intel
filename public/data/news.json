    "title": "Is Syria safe to return to?",

    "snippet": "Country: Syrian Arab Republic Source: Action on Armed Violence By Jennifer Dathan on 3 Dec 2025 Since the fall of Assad almost a year ago now, many countries hosting Syrian refugees have pushed for Syrians to return to Syria. Some countries have introduced financial incentives to aid their return, though these incentives often amount to very little when you are returning to a land devastated by conflict for more than a decade. Reports from initial returnees describe the instability and insecurity that come with returning. Some leave again, preferring the life in refugee camps to what Syria can currently offer. A recent report by Synaps , based on 130 interviews with Syrian refugees, returnees and aid sector professionals, detailed the challenges faced by those who have returned including Syria\u2019s ruined economy, destroyed infrastructure, and the absence of jobs or services. The article highlighted the dismal incentives offered by countries hosting refugees to encourage Syrian returnees and the absence of actual support that could enable many to return. Most of these countries have even slashed humanitarian funding supporting Syria and Syrian refugees. But beyond the gutted infrastructure and broken economy, it is worth asking: is Syria safe to return to? Over a decade of conflict has left Syria littered with unexploded ordnance, bombs that have failed to explode from all forces across Syria in the last decade, including by Turkey, Russia, USA, Syria, Israel, and, of course, Britain. There are also improvised explosive devices, left by Islamic State and other non-state actors, that lie in wait in homes and other areas. A whole spectrum of explosive arsenal litters countrysides and cities alike. Considering this, it is no surprise that a week doesn\u2019t go by without a report of a civilian, often a child, killed or maimed by one of these explosive remnants of war. Just last week at least 10 were killed and injured by explosive remnants, including two dead (one man and one child) and eight injured (one woman and seven children). Areas impacted include Aleppo, Daraa, Damascus, Deir Ezzor, Idlib. Date Incident Source Monday November 24th 2025 Woman and daughter injured by ERW exploded in stove in Bidama, Idlib https://npasyria.com/en/132489/ Monday November 24th 2025 Child grazing sheep severely injured by landmine explosion in Ghariba, Deir Ezzor https://npasyria.com/en/132489/ Monday November 24th 2025 Five children injured by explosion of war remnant in al-Danaji village, Damascus https://npasyria.com/en/132489/ Wednesday November 26th 2025 Tractor driver fatally injured by landmine explosion while farming in Al-Mazra\u2019a village, Aleppo https://www.syriahr.com/en/374055/ Friday November 28th 2025 Child killed in explosion of old grenade in Kafr Nasej village, Daraa https://www.syriahr.com/en/374162/ Other violent incidents across the country last week included 15 killed and 20 injured in Rif Dimashq by Israeli bombardment; a civilian killed by a Syrian armed drone in al-Suweida; a man shot by gunmen on a motorcycle in Homs; and five killed and nine injured in explosion at weapons warehouse belonging to Turkistan Islamic Party in Kafr Takharim, Idlib. In the first 10 months of this year at least 1,327 civilians have been killed and injured by unexploded ordnance across Syria, according to AOAV\u2019s figures \u2013 over 130 a month on average. With this in mind, last week\u2019s 10 casualties actually made for a comparatively quiet week. It is also worth reflecting that in the same period last year (Jan 2024 \u2013 Oct 2024), AOAV recorded 271 civilian casualties from UXO. While we cannot be sure, it seems likely that this 390% increase in civilian harm between these periods may reflect to some degree a rise in Syrians returning to homes across the country since the fall of Assad last December. On top of UXO casualties, violence still continues across the country, with 910 civilian deaths and injuries from explosive violence so far this year (to the end of October). These include 389 from air-launched explosives, 264 from ground-launched explosives, 234 from IEDs and landmines, and 23 from un unclear launch method. In a 2025 Humanity and Inclusion report, it was estimated that there are between 100,000 and 300,000 explosive items littering the country , and two-thirds of the population at immediate risk of death or injury due to the UXO. So, one year after Assad\u2019s fall, Syria\u2019s landscape is still defined by shattered infrastructure, urgent humanitarian need, and unexploded ordnance threatening daily life. Before urging returnees, host states \u2013 particularly in the West \u2013 must invest in rebuilding the conditions that make return possible. When those foundations are laid, it is likely many Syrians will wish to return.",

    "snippet": "Country: World Source: World Health Organization The World Health Organization (WHO) has released a new strategic plan for the management of coronavirus disease threats, including COVID-19, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and potential new coronavirus diseases. This is the first such unified plan for coronavirus disease threats, marking a turning point in the transition from the COVID-19 emergency response to sustained, long-term, and integrated management. Building on the lessons of the past five years of COVID-19 response and ongoing work on MERS and other respiratory diseases, the Strategic plan for coronavirus disease threat management: advancing integration, sustainability, and equity, 2025\u20132030 guides national health authorities and partners in taking a coherent, action-oriented approach to managing coronavirus disease threats in the broader context of infectious disease management. From the emergence and spread of the first SARS coronavirus in 2002 and MERS-CoV in 2012, to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in 2019, coronaviruses have repeatedly shown their capacity to trigger epidemics and pandemics. Although the global impact of COVID-19 has reduced since the peak of the pandemic, the virus continues to circulate widely, causing severe disease and death in high-risk groups. Around 6% of those infected develop Post COVID-19 Condition (also known as long COVID), with 15% of these people experiencing symptoms beyond a year. Several regions have recently reported increases in SARS-CoV-2 activity, and uncertainties persist around virus evolution and long-term impacts of COVID-19. \u201cCoronaviruses remain one of the most consequential infectious disease threats today,\u201d said Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO Acting Director for Epidemic and Pandemic Management. \u201cIntegrating their management into broader respiratory disease and infectious threat prevention and control programmes, including for influenza, is essential. While each country will have its own approach tailored to its national context, WHO urges Member States to use the strategic directions set out in the plan to build resilient health systems that can effectively manage current threats while preparing for future ones.\u201d The strategic plan builds on previous Strategic Preparedness and Response Plans for COVID-19 and reflects a consultative and inclusive process, drawing on input from WHO Member States, regional and country offices, technical partners, and the general public to ensure that the strategic plan is grounded in the diverse needs, priorities, and realities of health systems and communities worldwide. The plan encompasses both routine management as well as emergency scenarios, reflecting the flexibility national systems need to deal with known circulating coronaviruses and the emergence of a new coronavirus with pandemic potential. To strengthen global coronavirus monitoring, WHO has also expanded its Coronavirus Network (CoViNet), a network of disease surveillance programmes and reference laboratories for SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and emerging coronaviruses of public health significance. CoViNet now includes 45 national reference laboratories across the human, animal, and environmental health sectors, with 11 laboratories added in 2025. CoViNet complements WHO\u2019s Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), which conducts global sentinel surveillance, including for SARS-CoV-2.",

    "snippet": "CISA is aware of multiple cyber threat actors actively leveraging commercial spyware to target users of mobile messaging applications (apps). 1 These cyber actors use sophisticated targeting and social engineering techniques to deliver spyware and gain unauthorized access to a victim\u2019s messaging app, facilitating the deployment of additional malicious payloads that can further compromise the victim\u2019s mobile device. These cyber actors use tactics such as: Phishing and malicious device-linking QR codes to compromise victim accounts and link them to actor-controlled devices. Zero-click exploits, 2 which require no direct action from the device user. Impersonation 3 of messaging app platforms, such as Signal and WhatsApp. While current targeting remains opportunistic, evidence suggests these cyber actors focus on high-value individuals, such as current and former high-ranking government, military, and political officials, 4 as well as civil society organizations (CSOs) and individuals across the United States, 5 Middle East, 6 and Europe. 7 CISA strongly encourages messaging app users to review the updated Mobile Communications Best Practice Guidance and Mitigating Cyber Threats with Limited Resources: Guidance for Civil Society for steps to protect mobile communications and messaging apps, as well as mitigations against spyware.
