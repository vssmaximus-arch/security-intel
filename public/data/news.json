EXECUTIVE SUMMARY CVSS v4 8.7 ATTENTION : Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity Vendor : Mirion Medical Equipment : EC2 Software NMIS BioDose Vulnerabilities : Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, Use of Client-Side Authentication, Use of Hard-coded Credentials 2. RISK EVALUATION Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to modify program executables, gain access to sensitive information, gain unauthorized access to the application, and execute arbitrary code. 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following Mirion Medical products are affected: EC2 Software NMIS BioDose: Versions prior to 23.0 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW 3.2.1 INCORRECT PERMISSION ASSIGNMENT FOR CRITICAL RESOURCE CWE-732 NMIS/BioDose V22.02 and previous versions' installation directory paths by default have insecure file permissions, which in certain deployment scenarios can enable users on client workstations to modify the program executables and libraries. CVE-2025-64642 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H ). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2025-64642 . A base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N ). 3.2.2 INCORRECT PERMISSION ASSIGNMENT FOR CRITICAL RESOURCE CWE-732 NMIS/BioDose V22.02 and previous version installations where the embedded Microsoft SQLServer Express is used are exposed in the Windows share accessed by clients in networked installs. By default, this directory has insecure directory paths that allow access to the SQL Server database and configuration files, which can contain sensitive data. CVE-2025-64298 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H ). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2025-64298 . A base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N ). 3.2.3 USE OF CLIENT-SIDE AUTHENTICATION CWE-603 NMIS/BioDose V22.02 and previous versions rely on a common SQL Server user account to access data in the database. User access in the client application is restricted by a password authentication check in the client software but the underlying database connection always has access. The latest version of NMIS/BioDose introduces an option to use Windows user authentication with the database, which would restrict this database connection. CVE-2025-61940 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L ). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2025-61940 . A base score of 8.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N ). 3.2.4 USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798 NMIS/BioDose software V22.02 and previous versions contain executable binaries with plain text hard-coded passwords. These hard-coded passwords could allow unauthorized access to both the application and database. CVE-2025-64778 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L ). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2025-64778 . A base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N ). 3.2.5 INCORRECT PERMISSION ASSIGNMENT FOR CRITICAL RESOURCE CWE-732 NMIS/BioDose V22.02 and previous versions rely on a Microsoft SQL Server database. The SQL user account 'nmdbuser' and other created accounts by default have the sysadmin role. This can lead to remote code execution through the use of certain built-in stored procedures. CVE-2025-62575 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L ). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2025-62575 . A base score of 8.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N ). 3.3 BACKGROUND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS: Healthcare and Public Health COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED: Worldwide COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION: United States 3.4 RESEARCHER Joe Dillon reported these vulnerabilities to Mirion Medical. 4.

Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 ML-Commons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of 3 open-weight LLM judges, whose binary safety assessments were validated on a stratified human-labeled subset. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches. These findings demonstrate that stylistic variation alone can circumvent contemporary safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols...",

Sixteen months later, however, Mozilla is still promoting Onerep. This week, Mozilla announced their partnership with Onerep will officially end next month.",

Some affected Cloudflare customers were able to pivot away from the platform temporarily so that visitors could still access their websites.

Experts says a glut of proxies from Aisuru and other sources is fueling large-scale data harvesting efforts tied to various artificial intelligence (AI) projects, helping content scrapers evade detection by routing their traffic through residential connections that appear to be regular Internet users.",
