This guidance aims to help critical infrastructure owners and operators integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into operational technology (OT) systems securely, balancing the benefits of AI\u2014such as increased efficiency, enhanced decision-making, and cost savings\u2014with the unique risks it poses to the safety, security, and reliability of OT environments. The document focuses on machine learning (ML), large language models (LLMs), and AI agents due to their complex security challenges, but is also applicable to systems using traditional statistical modeling and logic-based automation. Key Principles for Secure AI Integration: Understand AI: Educate personnel on AI risks, impacts, and secure development lifecycles. Assess AI Use in OT: Evaluate business cases, manage OT data security risks, and address immediate and long-term integration challenges. Establish AI Governance: Implement governance frameworks, test AI models continuously, and ensure regulatory compliance. Embed Safety and Security: Maintain oversight, ensure transparency, and integrate AI into incident response plans. Critical infrastructure owners and operators are encouraged to adopt these principles to maximize AI benefits while mitigating risks. For further details, review the full guidance .

User access in the client application is restricted by a password authentication check in the client software but the underlying database connection always has access. The latest version of NMIS/BioDose introduces an option to use Windows user authentication with the database, which would restrict this database connection. CVE-2025-61940 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L ).

These hard-coded passwords could allow unauthorized access to both the application and database. CVE-2025-64778 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L ). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2025-64778 . A base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N ). 3.2.5 INCORRECT PERMISSION ASSIGNMENT FOR CRITICAL RESOURCE CWE-732 NMIS/BioDose V22.02 and previous versions rely on a Microsoft SQL Server database. The SQL user account 'nmdbuser' and other created accounts by default have the sysadmin role. This can lead to remote code execution through the use of certain built-in stored procedures.

    "snippet": "CISA is aware of multiple cyber threat actors actively leveraging commercial spyware to target users of mobile messaging applications (apps). 1 These cyber actors use sophisticated targeting and social engineering techniques to deliver spyware and gain unauthorized access to a victim\u2019s messaging app, facilitating the deployment of additional malicious payloads that can further compromise the victim\u2019s mobile device. These cyber actors use tactics such as: Phishing and malicious device-linking QR codes to compromise victim accounts and link them to actor-controlled devices. Zero-click exploits, 2 which require no direct action from the device user. Impersonation 3 of messaging app platforms, such as Signal and WhatsApp. While current targeting remains opportunistic, evidence suggests these cyber actors focus on high-value individuals, such as current and former high-ranking government, military, and political officials, 4 as well as civil society organizations (CSOs) and individuals across the United States, 5 Middle East, 6 and Europe. 7 CISA strongly encourages messaging app users to review the updated Mobile Communications Best Practice Guidance and Mitigating Cyber Threats with Limited Resources: Guidance for Civil Society for steps to protect mobile communications and messaging apps, as well as mitigations against spyware.

RISK EVALUATION Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Appleton UPSMON-PRO. 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following Emerson products are affected: Appleton UPSMON-PRO: Versions 2.6 and prior 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW 3.2.1 STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121 A crafted UDP packet sent to the default UDP port 2601 can cause an overflow of the buffer stack, overwriting critical memory locations. This could allow unauthorized individuals to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges if the UPSMONProService service communication is not properly validated. CVE-2024-3871 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H ). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2024-3871 .

MITIGATIONS According to Emerson, Appleton UPSMON-PRO is End of Life and unsupported. Any users still using the product are recommended to replace the product or apply the following mitigations based on your company policies and Cybersecurity Operational recommendations. Recommended Actions if not replaced: Block UDP port 2601 at firewall level for all UPSMON-PRO installations Isolate UPS monitoring networks from general corporate networks Implement network-level packet filtering to reject oversized UDP packets to port 2601 Monitor for UPSMONProSer.exe service crashes as potential indicators of exploitation attempts Long-term Strategy Recommendation: Replace UPSMON-PRO with actively supported UPS monitoring solution Implement defense-in-depth strategies for critical power infrastructure monitoring CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as: Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet . Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks. When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures. CISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics . Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies . CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
