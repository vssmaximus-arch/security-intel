Why it matters: Claiming they were blindsided by reports of a second strike, Senate Democrats are demanding a thorough congressional investigation and calling on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to resign. Four Democratic members of the Senate Armed Services Committee told Axios on Tuesday that administration officials who briefed lawmakers did not mention a second strike on one of the boats. The Washington Post reported last week that Hegseth in September ordered that no survivors be left following a boat strike off the coast of Venezuela. The White House said Monday that U.S. Special Operations Command head Adm. Frank Bradley, and not Hegseth , directed a September strike on a suspected drug boat near Venezuela to ensure that it was \"destroyed.\" Zoom in: Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Az.) told Axios Tuesday that administration officials \"certainly didn't tell us\" that there were survivors that were hit with a second strike. \"I don't remember them sharing those details that (White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt) shared at the podium,\" Kelly said. Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) told Axios that \"we have not seen the videos, we have not been briefed on any of that.\" Rosen said Hegseth \"needs to resign.\" Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), an Armed Services member who is also the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said she didn't know about a second strike \"until it was reported.\" Zoom out: Lawmakers have battled for months with the White House about the administration's sharing of information about military activities — with Democrats complaining that they've been iced out. \"The DoD owes the entire committee, the House and the Senate answers to this,\" Kelly said. \"This is a serious situation.\" Sens. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.), the top lawmakers on the Armed Services panel, will meet with Bradley this week and have publicly pledged to investigate the situation. Rosen said it was \"her understanding, per Jack Reed, that we will be having an investigation ... so that means that we have the subpoena power to call people there.\"",

    "title": "Another SNAP disruption looms unless states give Trump their immigration data",
    "url": "https://www.axios.com/2025/12/02/trump-snap-benefits-pause-democrat-states-immigration",
    "snippet_raw": "The Trump administration will pause aid for Democrat-led states that don't provide the government with identifying information about SNAP recipients , such as immigration status, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said on Tuesday. Why it matters: If the administration goes through with the threat, millions of Americans could lose their SNAP benefits , sometimes known as food stamps , just over a month after recipients were put in limbo during the longest-ever government shutdown. Driving the news: Rollins said her department asked all states \"to turn over their data\" to the federal government in February so that USDA and state agencies could \"root out\" any fraud in the system. Rollins said Republican-led states complied and those records helped the administration determine examples of food stamp fraud, but Democrat-run states including California, New York and Minnesota \"continue to say no.\" It was not clear from Rollins remarks if the administration had proof of fraud prior to requesting the data and USDA representatives did not immediately respond to Axios' request to clarify this. What they're saying: Rollins slammed Democrats for not doing more to tackle \"rampant fraud\" in the SNAP program on Tuesday during the president's ninth cabinet meeting of the year. \"As of next week, we have begun and will begin to stop moving federal funds into those states, until they comply, and they tell us and allow us to partner with them to root out this fraud and to protect the American taxpayer,\" she said. When asked for clarification, the USDA told Axios in an emailed statement that they have sent \"Democrat States yet another request for data, and if they fail to comply, they will be provided with formal warning that USDA will pull their administrative funds.\" The department also alleged that non-compliant states were choosing to \"protect illegals, criminals, and bad actors over the American taxpayer.\" By the numbers: Roughly 800,000 of the 42 million Americans who rely on food stamps have moved off the program since Trump retook office, according to Rollins. However, Rollins claimed that of the recipients still receiving benefits, the department identified various examples of fraud, including dead people still receiving dollars and some social security numbers being registered to receive money in more than one state. Axios was not able to immediately verify Rollins' specific fraud claims, but the Government Accountability Office has estimated that states have replaced more than $320 million in stolen benefits between October 2022 and December 2024. GAO notes that not all victims of benefit theft know they could have been reimbursed, so the actual dollar amount could be higher. Catch up quick: SNAP benefits rarely dominate political discourse, but the Trump administration's unprecedented decision to cut off benefits for millions of Americans during the government shutdown has pushed the program into the spotlight. The freeze was particularly consequential as most beneficiaries are senior citizens and children, and most need their funds immediately because they use the totality of their allotted dollars within the month the money is dispersed. The administration eventually released all benefits once the shutdown ended, after filing appeal after appeal to avoid having to pay recipients money. Zoom out: The Trump administration has systematically frozen federal funds to coerce Democratic-run cities — particularly those run by Black politicians — to comply with the president's demands. That included freezing roughly $18 billion for two infrastructure projects in New York City in October. And some $2.1 billion in Department of Transportation funding for the Chicago transit system was paused as well. Go deeper: The food crisis is here",

    "snippet_raw": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Tuesday that he did not personally see any survivors after the initial strike on a purported drug vessel that was later hit with a subsequent attack. The big picture: Hegseth and administration allies have denied a report that the military conducted a follow-up strike on alleged \"narco-terrorists\" who survived an initial hit in compliance with a directive to leave no survivors. If substantiated, legal experts say, the orders could violate international law. The White House has defended the legality of the attack and the order they say was issued by Admiral Frank Bradley to \"ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated.\" The strikes have killed more than 80 people in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, as international scrutiny grows over the legal grounds on which the administration is waging its pressure campaign against Venezuela. Driving the news: Hegseth said at a Cabinet meeting that he watched the first strike live but left before learning hours later that Bradley made the call to sink the boat. Pressed by a reporter, Hegseth said he did not \"personally see survivors\" on the burning vessel. \"This is called the fog of war,\" he said before taking aim at journalists. \"This is what you and the press don't understand.\" State of play: There have been 21 kinetic strikes on alleged drug boats so far, and 82 people killed, Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said in a news conference Tuesday. \"Our operations in the SOUTHCOM region are lawful under both US and international law, with all actions in compliance with the law of armed conflict, these actions have also been approved by the best military and civilian lawyers up and down the chain of command,\" she said. Friction point: The administration has remained adamant that the early September strike and those that followed are on steady legal ground, though some lawmakers have accused officials of leaving them in the dark. Multiple outlets have reported that the administration has justified the attacks by saying cartels are engaged in an armed conflict with the U.S., though some legal experts have disputed that conclusion. Hegseth on Tuesday compared the approach to targeting the vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific to missions to take out Al-Qaeda and ISIS. What we're watching: The secretary also signaled during the Cabinet meeting, sitting beside the president, that the lethal attacks would continue. \"We've only just begun striking narco-boats and putting narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean,\" he said. Go deeper: Hegseth says U.S. has \"only just begun\" sinking alleged drug vessels",

    "snippet_raw": "During a long phone call on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked President Trump for more support in his push for a pardon from Israel's president, two U.S. officials and one Israeli official said. The big picture: In a conversation that largely focused on Gaza and Syria, the leaders also discussed Netanyahu's ongoing corruption trial . Trump has repeatedly intervened in Israel's judicial process and domestic politics to push for an end to those proceedings. Last month, Trump sent an official letter to Israeli President Isaac Herzog denouncing the charges against Netanyahu as \"political lawfare\" and calling on Herzog to issue a pardon. Driving the news: On Sunday, Netanyahu sent an official letter to Herzog requesting a pardon to allow him to focus on Israel's national security and regional peace agreements. Herzog said he'll consider Netanyahu's request after getting all the necessary legal opinions. That process could take two months. During Monday's call, Netanyahu asked Trump to continue supporting his effort to secure a pardon, according to the two U.S. officials. Behind the scenes: Trump told Netanyahu he thinks the pardon will work out but didn't commit to any further steps, one U.S. official said. \"Netanyahu wants Trump to do more, but the president has done all he can do,\" a second U.S. official said. An Israeli official claimed Trump was the one who raised the pardon issue and said the prime minister and the president had agreed to continue discussing it going forward. Zoom out: During the call, Trump also pressed Netanyahu to change course in Gaza and Syria. On Gaza: Trump told Netanyahu he should be \"a better partner\" in implementing the peace agreement. Netanyahu said he's doing the best he can, the U.S. officials said. Trump asked Netanyahu why Israel was killing the Hamas militants trapped in tunnels in the Israeli-controlled areas of Gaza rather than letting them surrender. The Israeli prime minister pushed back and said it's because \"they are armed and dangerous,\" the officials said. The U.S. tried to broker a deal between Israel and Hamas whereby the trapped militants would receive amnesty if they surrendered. The Trump administration saw that as a potential model for disarming Hamas. On Syria: A U.S. official said Trump told Netanyahu to \"take it easy\" when it comes to military action in Syria and \"not provoke\" the Syrian government. The call came three days after Israeli airstrikes in Syria killed 13 people and outraged Damascus. \"The president told Netanyahu that the new leadership in Syria is trying to make it a better place,\" the official said. After the call, Netanyahu seemed to be changing his tone on Syria. He said in a statement on Tuesday that it is \"possible to reach an agreement with the Syrians\" if Israel's demands are met.",

    "snippet_raw": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth struck a defiant tone Tuesday, telling reporters during a Cabinet meeting that the military has \"only just begun\" sinking \"narco-terrorists\" to \"the bottom of the ocean.\" The big picture: The Trump administration has rallied around Hegseth following a report that the military in September conducted a second strike on an alleged drug vessel near Venezuela to kill any survivors, which legal experts warn could violate the laws of war. The White House said Hegseth authorized a Navy admiral to conduct the strikes, which the administration argues was within his authority and the bounds of the law. Driving the news: \"We've only just begun striking narco-boats and putting narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean because they've been poisoning the American people,\" Hegseth said from the president's side. But \"it's hard to find boats to strike right now,\" he said to laughter in the room, adding that \"deterrence has to matter — not arrest and hand over and then do it again.\" State of play: The strikes have killed more than 80 people in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific. The Washington Post reported last week that Hegseth had given a verbal directive to kill everyone on a boat suspected of carrying drugs, leading Adm. Frank M. Bradley to order a second strike. Hegseth denies the report, but lawmakers have vowed vigorous bipartisan oversight. The New York Times subsequently reported that Hegseth ordered a lethal strike ahead of the Sept. 2 attack but did not specifically address what would happen if a first strike didn't sink the boat and kill those aboard. Between the lines: The Defense Department's Law of War Manual uses shooting shipwrecked survivors as an example of an illegal order that service members are obligated to refuse. The manual also states that those \"who have been incapacitated by wounds, sickness, or shipwreck are in a helpless state, and it would be dishonorable and inhumane to make them the object of attack.\" What they're saying: \" Admiral Mitch Bradley is an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100% support,\" Hegseth wrote in a Monday social media post . \"I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made — on the September 2 mission and all others since.\" Go deeper: Trump allies dismiss reported attacks on Venezuelan boat strike survivors",

    "url": "https://www.axios.com/2025/12/02/mass-killings-us-drop-record-low-2025",
    "snippet_raw": "Data: Mass Killing Database ; Chart: Axios Visuals Mass killings in the U.S. so far this year have dropped to their lowest level since researchers began tracking mass homicides in 2006. The big picture: This decline tracks with a broader cooling of violent crime across the U.S. following pandemic-era spikes, though criminologists suggest the drop may simply mark a return to historic averages. Experts also note mass-killing numbers can swing sharply year to year because the totals are small. The fine print: The database—maintained by the Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern University—counts incidents where four or more people are intentionally killed in a 24-hour period, not including the killer. Driving the news: A recent shooting at a child's birthday party in California that killed three children and one adult brought the number of mass killings so far in 2025 to 17, according to the database. So far, 2025 has seen the lowest number of such tragedies since 2006, the first year of available data in the database. The highest number, 46, was recorded in 2019. Zoom out: The Gun Violence Archive, a separate database that uses a broader definition to include shootings where victims survived, similarly recorded a drop in both mass shootings and mass murders so far in 2025. The archive tracked 381 mass shootings so far in 2025, with the most recent an incident that injured four men in St. Paul on Monday. Last year, the archive tracked 503 mass shootings — down from 659 in 2023. Worth noting: The AP–USA Today mass killing database found that most mass killings in the U.S. involve guns. This year, 14 of the 17 incidents involved firearms, and of the 629 total mass killings since 2006 in the database, 79% involved firearms. One stunning stat: While news coverage often centers around mass killings in public, the database shows that around 67% happen in and around people's homes. Catch up quick: Violent crimes rates in major cities across the country have been on the decline after a COVID-era spike. But the shadow of gun violence is pervasive in the U.S., where around 1 in 15 adults has been on the scene at a mass shooting, according to a study reviewed by Axios' Alayna Alvarez. The bottom line: While mass killings fell this year to date, that statistic alone does not necessarily fully capture grim reality of gun violence in the U.S. For example, the Annunciation Catholic Church shooting earlier this year that killed two children does not fit the definition of a mass killing and is therefore not counted on the database. But there has been progress on initiatives targeting gun violence, such as those driven by a 2022 bipartisan gun safety bill signed into law by former President Biden.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY CVSS v4 8.7 ATTENTION : Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity Vendor : Mirion Medical Equipment : EC2 Software NMIS BioDose Vulnerabilities : Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, Use of Client-Side Authentication, Use of Hard-coded Credentials 2. RISK EVALUATION Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to modify program executables, gain access to sensitive information, gain unauthorized access to the application, and execute arbitrary code. 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following Mirion Medical products are affected: EC2 Software NMIS BioDose: Versions prior to 23.0 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW 3.2.1 INCORRECT PERMISSION ASSIGNMENT FOR CRITICAL RESOURCE CWE-732 NMIS/BioDose V22.02 and previous versions' installation directory paths by default have insecure file permissions, which in certain deployment scenarios can enable users on client workstations to modify the program executables and libraries. CVE-2025-64642 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H ). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2025-64642 . A base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N ). 3.2.2 INCORRECT PERMISSION ASSIGNMENT FOR CRITICAL RESOURCE CWE-732 NMIS/BioDose V22.02 and previous version installations where the embedded Microsoft SQLServer Express is used are exposed in the Windows share accessed by clients in networked installs. By default, this directory has insecure directory paths that allow access to the SQL Server database and configuration files, which can contain sensitive data. CVE-2025-64298 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H ). A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2025-64298 . A base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N ). 3.2.3 USE OF CLIENT-SIDE AUTHENTICATION CWE-603 NMIS/BioDose V22.02 and previous versions rely on a common SQL Server user account to access data in the database.

    "url": "https://www.axios.com/2025/12/02/trump-pardons-hernandez-absolute-power",
    "snippet_raw": "President Trump has embraced clemency as an expression of raw political power, seizing on a unique authority designed to go unchecked by Congress, the Constitution or the courts. Why it matters: No presidential power is more absolute than the pardon. And no president has wielded it more openly as a tool of personal and ideological loyalty than Donald Trump. Zoom in: Trump's extraordinary move to pardon former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández — convicted last year of flooding the U.S. with tons of cocaine — is among the clearest examples yet. Prosecutors said Hernández, who led Honduras from 2014 to 2022, conspired with cartels to pave a \"cocaine superhighway\" into the U.S. — posing as an anti-drug conservative while running his country like a narco state. In an Oct. 28 letter to Trump obtained by Axios , Hernández alleged that he was \"targeted by the Biden-Harris administration not for any wrongdoing, but for political reasons.\" The appeal, laced with effusive praise for Trump and claims of common persecution, appeared to work. Trump granted the pardon request, claiming Hernández was \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later called it a \"clear Biden over-prosecution.\" Left unmentioned: Emil Bove, a former member of Trump's legal team who's now a federal judge, was a lead prosecutor on Hernández's case while working for the Southern District of New York. Between the lines: The Hernández pardon fits squarely within Trump's view of justice — serious criminal conduct matters far less than whether the defendant pledges loyalty, flatters the president or aligns with his ideological project. While the right-wing Hernández walks free from his 45-year prison sentence, left-wing Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro — indicted on charges of narcoterrorism — faces the threat of a U.S. military invasion. \"If someone sells drugs in their country, that doesn't mean you arrest the president and put him in jail for the rest of his life,\" Trump told reporters Sunday when pressed on why he pardoned Hernández. Zoom out: The dynamic extends to Trump's domestic orbit, where MAGA-friendly financiers, operatives and celebrity allies have had their convictions wiped away with the stroke of Trump's pen. Changpeng Zhao (\"CZ\"): The billionaire founder of crypto giant Binance was pardoned despite pleading guilty in 2023 to money laundering violations. Trump — whose family's crypto venture has ties to Binance — later claimed he did not know CZ, saying on \"60 Minutes\": \"I heard it was a Biden witch hunt.\" George Santos: The disgraced former GOP congressman — convicted of defrauding donors and lying to the House — had his seven-year sentence commuted by Trump after spending less than three months in prison. Paul Walczak: Trump pardoned the former nursing home executive, who pleaded guilty to tax crimes, less than three weeks after his mother attended a $1 million-per-person fundraising dinner at Mar-a-Lago. A White House official claimed Walczak was \"targeted by the Biden administration over his family's conservative politics.\" Fake electors: Trump granted sweeping pardons to Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows and more than 70 allies tied to efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including the \"alternate electors\" scheme. Many never faced federal charges, raising questions about whether Trump was seeking to interfere in state prosecutions, which are not covered by pardons. The other side: As Trump has granted pardons to dozens of white-collar criminals , he's ordered the Justice Department to investigate his political enemies for less serious allegations, such as mortgage fraud. Trump loyalist Ed Martin — who is leading investigations of New York Attorney General Letitia James and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) — holds the position of both U.S. pardon attorney and weaponization czar. \"No MAGA left behind,\" Martin tweeted after the pardon of former Virginia sheriff Scott Jenkins, a Trump supporter convicted on bribery charges. What they're saying: \" There's a whole team of qualified lawyers who look at every single pardon request that ultimately make their way up to the president of the United States,\" Leavitt said last month of Trump's decision-making process on pardons. \"The only pardons anyone should be critical of are from President Autopen,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement, referring to President Biden, who she said \"pardoned and commuted sentences of violent criminals including child killers and mass murderers ... not to mention the proactive pardons he 'signed' for his family members like Hunter on his way out the door.\" The bottom line: On Day One, Trump launched a radical redefinition of presidential clemency by pardoning roughly 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants , including supporters charged with seditious conspiracy. It was a signal that those who act in Trump's name will be shielded — and that those who don't, won't.",

And yet thanks to subtle, considered performances, a finely milled script, inventive craftsmanship and a deep sense of empathy for the precarious lives of refugees, it packs a considerable wallop. The story starts with reticent, clearly traumatised Nigerian Isio, played by Ronke Adekoluejo, who is subtle throughout in a role that could easily have been done with too broad a brush. Isio arrives at a women’s shelter for asylum seekers in the UK where she is assigned to share a room with Farah (a luminous Ann Akinjirin), who is already a few steps ahead of Isio in the legal process that permits applicants to appeal twice. (If the second appeal isn’t approved, applicants are immediately deported.) Although Isio is a bit standoffish at first, gentle Farah shows her roommate the ropes, warning her not to trust the guards, to watch out for the tough women dealing drugs in the yard, and to try not to lose hope.

    "snippet_raw": "In today’s newsletter: As suppliers get ready to meet policy makers and space agencies at the industry’s largest gathering, a look at the exploration and exploitation of space Good morning. This week Glasgow hosts one of the UK’s largest ever gatherings of the space industry at Space-Comm . With representatives of Nasa, the UK and Scottish governments and the UK space agency among 2,000 space leaders gathering there, it is a chance for people in the commercial supply chain of the space exploration industry to meet policy makers and space agencies. It comes at a crucial moment in the exploration – and exploitation – of space. For almost three decades the International Space Station (ISS) has bound the US and Russia into cooperation and shared interests. That project is nearing its end, and we can expect to see a realignment of missions and goals – which may bring states and scientists into conflict. Politics | Britain’s budget watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has said the early leak of its budget documents before Rachel Reeves made her speech last week, was the “worst failure” in its 15-year history , as its chair resigned and it emerged a similar leak had happened earlier this year. Health | The World Health Organization has urged countries to make weight loss drugs more accessible and pharmaceutical companies to lower their prices, saying jabs including Mounjaro represent a “new chapter” in the fight against obesity. Ukraine | The coming days may be “pivotal” for talks to end the war in Ukraine , the EU’s top diplomat said, as Volodymyr Zelenskyy met Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Monday and the US envoy Steve Witkoff flew out to meet Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Tuesday. Donald Trump | Donald Trump said he “wouldn’t have wanted” a second strike that the US military reportedly conducted on a boat in the Caribbean that it believed to be ferrying drugs, killing survivors of an initial missile attack . The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, has urged Washington to investigate, saying there was “strong evidence” of “extrajudicial” killings. Asia-Pacific | Sri Lanka and Indonesia have deployed military personnel to help victims of the torrential floods that have killed 1,100 in four countries in Asia. Heavy cyclones and tropical monsoon rains have hit the region in recent days. Continue reading...",

    "snippet_raw": "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said after meeting with President Trump on Monday that she's recommending a travel ban on multiple countries in connection with criminal activity in the U.S. The big picture: Trump widened his administration's hardline immigration crackdown after officials said the suspect in last Wednesday's ambush-style shooting in D.C. that killed one National Guard member and critically injured another was an Afghan national . Zoom in: \"I am recommending a full travel ban on every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies,\" Noem said on X, without specifying which countries she was referring to. \"Our forefathers built this nation on blood, sweat, and the unyielding love of freedom — not for foreign invaders to slaughter our heroes, suck dry our hard-earned tax dollars, or snatch the benefits owed to AMERICANS,\" Noem said. \"WE DON'T WANT THEM. NOT ONE.\" Context: White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News in a Monday night interview that Trump shared on Truth Social that the president had several months ago \"announced a travel ban on 19 third-world and failed state countries around the world.\" Now, Noem is \"recommending that travel ban widens and covers more countries around the globe,\" Leavitt added. State of play: The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services last week announced a review of every green card holder from 19 countries of \"concern,\" including Afghanistan, Iran, Haiti and Venezuela, which Leavitt appeared to be referring to in her interview. These countries featured in a June proclamation , titled: \"Restricting the entry of foreign nationals to protect the United States from foreign terrorists and other national security and public security threats.\" Trump said last week he \"will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover,\" but his administration did not immediately clarify which countries would be targeted by this. What they're saying: The White House referred Axios to the Department of Homeland Security for comment on which countries would be targeted in Noem's travel ban plan, and the DHS said it would be \"announcing the list soon.\" The State Department, which typically processes visas, did not immediately respond to Axios' Monday night request for comment.

    "snippet_raw": "The 14 FEMA employees who signed the so-called Katrina declaration went back to work for a little while Monday — but the Department of Homeland Security now says that should never have happened. Why it matters: A spokesperson for DHS told Axios in an email that their employees' reinstatement was unauthorized. \"CNN reporting revealed that 14 FEMA employees previously placed on leave for misconduct were wrongly and without authorization reinstated by bureaucrats acting outside of their authority,\" the department said in an email. \"Once alerted, the unauthorized reinstatement was swiftly corrected by senior leadership. The 14 employees who signed the Katrina declaration have been returned to administrative leave.\" Catch up quick: The employees were placed on leave this summer after signing the petition protesting the Trump administration's disaster response efforts. Dubbed the Katrina Declaration and sent to Congress in August, the petition warned that cuts to the agency were putting people and property at risk, and were a departure from improvements in disaster response put in place after the botched response to the devastating 2005 Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. Just one day after it was made public, the Department of Homeland Security put signers who had used their full names on indefinite leave — one employee was fired. The signers then filed complaints with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal agency that investigates whistleblower complaints. Zoom in: They received notices of their reinstatement last week, and were ordered to return to the office Monday. But by the afternoon, they received memos ordering them back on leave, said David Seide, senior counsel at the Government Accountability Project, a nonprofit group that helped workers file their complaints. \"It's appalling that the politicos have overruled the managers,\" he tells Axios. Zoom out: Previously in the day, Seide said the reinstatement would help his group make the case to reinstate other workers in similar situations. to argue for other government workers. \"I'd expect them to treat it as meaningful precedent.\" 144 employees at the EPA were put on leave in July, and seven were fired, after putting out a similar letter. Last month, the NIH placed Jenna Norton on leave. Norton signed a similar petition, deemed the \" Bethesda Declaration .\" The big picture: It's far more difficult to fire federal workers than those in the private sector — though the Trump administration has been pushing to change that. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been terminated or pushed out of work by the administration this year. Though a few efforts — like conducting layoffs during the shutdown — have been thwarted. Zoom out: President Trump has floated \"getting rid of\" FEMA in the past, and putting the responsibility for disaster relief more squarely in the hands of the states. But the White House backed away from that stance after devastating floods in Texas last summer. What they're saying: \"They were all so excited to return to work,\" says Colette Delawalla, CEO of Stand up for Science, a nonnprofit advocacy group started this year that's working with these employees. They're a group devoted to the mission of FEMA, she tells Axios. A few of them had been pulled from working on disaster relief efforts in Texas after deadly flooding there this summer. \"They're pretty upset now.\" More from Axios: Post-Katrina safeguards being eroded at FEMA, employees warn Multiple FEMA staff put on leave after letter criticizing Trump admin Editor's note: This article and the headline have been updated to reflect comment from the Department of Homeland Security saying the FEMA workers were wrongly reinstated, and it's been updated with comment from Stand up for Science CEO Colette Delawalla.",

    "url": "https://www.axios.com/2025/12/01/jeffries-hegseth-impeach-venezuela-drug-boats",
    "snippet_raw": "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) signaled Monday that Democrats are unlikely to pursue impeachment against Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth over alleged follow-up strikes against boats in the Caribbean. Why it matters: Impeachment has been a fraught subject for Democrats this year, with Jeffries acknowledging that Republican control of both chambers of Congress makes any impeachment effort virtually dead on arrival. \"Republicans will never allow articles of impeachment to be brought to the floor of the House of Representatives, and we know that's the case,\" Jeffries said at a press conference Monday. \"Donald Trump will order them not to do it,\" he added. Driving the news: White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt denied Monday that Hegseth was the one who ordered a second strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat on Sept. 2 to take out survivors of an earlier strike. The Washington Post reported last week thay Hegseth's directive in the operation was, in the words of one anonymous source, to \"kill everybody,\" which led a military commander to order a second strike. Leavitt said Hegseth \"authorized Admiral [Frank] Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes. He worked well within his authority and the law.\" What they're saying: \"The White House is lying, but that's no surprise,\" Jeffries said at his press conference when asked by Axios about Leavitt's comments. \"It is my understanding that Pete Hegseth, the so-called secretary of defense, was absolutely involved. I think he may have even recently acknowledged that because the facts are incapable of being disputed.\" Jeffries reiterated his past call for Hegseth to resign voluntarily, saying he is \"the most unqualified secretary of defense in American history.\" What to watch: The top Republican and Democrat on both the House and Senate Armed Services committees have said they plan to vigorously investigate the reporting. Jeffries leaned on those probes as the alternative to impeachment, telling reporters: \"What's on the table is a meaningful investigation which we can hope would be bipartisan.\"",

    "title": "\"Bibi sees ghosts everywhere\": U.S. alarmed by Israel's Syria strikes",
    "url": "https://www.axios.com/2025/12/01/israel-syria-strikes-trump-netanyahu",
    "snippet_raw": "The Trump administration is concerned that Israel's repeated strikes inside Syria risk destabilizing the country and undermining hopes of an Israel-Syria security agreement, two senior U.S. officials tell Axios. \"We are trying to tell Bibi he has to stop this because if it continues he will self-destruct,\" one of those officials said, referring to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by his nickname. The big picture: Supporting President Ahmed al-Sharaa's efforts to stabilize Syria and encouraging him to engage in a peace process with Israel are key elements of the Trump administration's Middle East strategy. President Trump and his team have repeatedly sided with Syria's government in disputes with Israel— the only country in the region for which that's the case. On Monday, Trump posted on Truth Social in support of al-Sharaa and said it was \"very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria's evolution into a prosperous State.\" The U.S. officials made clear they think Netanyahu is interfering in very unhelpful ways. He has ordered military action across the border in Syria on several occasions, including in the past few days. Driving the news: Israeli forces conducting a raid less than 10 miles into Syrian territory on Friday came under fire from unknown gunmen after arresting suspected militants, with six Israeli soldiers injured, according to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). While trying to extract its forces, the IDF unleashed airstrikes that killed 13 Syrians, many of them civilians. The raid and airstrikes — which took place beyond the portion of Syrian territory Israel has been occupying since the fall of the Assad regime — enraged the Syrian government and generated calls from inside Syria for retaliation. \"The Syrians were going nuts. Their own constituents demanded retaliation because Syrian civilians were killed,\" a U.S. official said. Behind the scenes: The U.S. officials told Axios the White House did not receive prior notice of the Israeli operation, and that the Israelis didn't warn Syria through military channels as they have in past cases. Israeli officials claimed the suspects were were part of a group affiliated with Hamas and Hezbollah and had planned attacks against Israel, and that Israel informed the Syrians through intelligence channels. Friction point: U.S. officials working on Middle East issues have fumed for months at what they see as Netanyahu's shoot first, ask questions later approach to Syria. \"Syria doesn't want problems with Israel. This isn't Lebanon,\" a senior U.S. official said, drawing a distinction between Israel's recent strikes in the two countries. \"But Bibi is seeing ghosts everywhere.\" \"We are trying to tell Bibi he has to stop this because if it continues he will self-destruct — miss a huge diplomatic opportunity and turn the new Syrian government to an enemy,\" the official continued. This isn't the first time such sentiments have bubbled up. After Israel's brazen strikes on Damascus in June, a White House official told Axios: \"Bibi acted like a madman. He bombs everything all the time. This could undermine what Trump is trying to do.\" The other side: Trump's embrace of al-Sharaa, a former al-Qaeda commander, has worried the Israelis. They were shocked when Trump met the rebel-turned-president last May in Saudi Arabia, and uncomfortable with the chumminess between the two during their historic Oval Office meeting this month. The Israelis also objected to Trump's decision to lift U.S. sanctions on Syria. While the Israelis have engaged with U.S. efforts to advance an Israel-Syria security pact, they've done so warily and presented maximalist demands. State of play: Two U.S. officials told Axios that Netanyahu's actions had now partially undermined work on a deal, which Washington hopes will be the first step to Syria joining the Abraham Accords at a later date. Since Friday, U.S. envoy to Syria Tom Barrack and other Trump administration officials have held tense conversations with their Israeli counterparts on that topic. U.S. officials held similar talks to try to calm down the Syrians and avoid further escalation. On Monday, Barrack met al-Sharaa in Damascus. The U.S. officials said it's not clear who holds the Syria file in Israel's government after the resignation of Netanyahu's confidant Ron Dermer. The latest: On Monday, Trump weighed in publicly with the Truth Social post praising al-Sharaa and cautioning Israel. Trump spoke with Netanyahu shortly after the post, though the Israeli readout said Trump had invited Netanyahu to D.C. and didn't mention Syria.",

    "url": "https://www.axios.com/2025/12/01/pete-hegseth-venezuelan-boat-survivors-strike",
    "snippet_raw": "A Navy admiral and not Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed a September strike on a suspected drug boat near Venezuela where the military was reportedly ordered to kill survivors, the White House said Monday. Why it matters: The White House defended the legality of the attack, but Congress has vowed to investigate with some members warning that, if substantiated , the deaths could violate the laws of war. What they're saying: \"On Sept. 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Admiral [Frank] Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a news briefing. \"Admiral Bradley worked well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated.\" In response to a question asking her to confirm that an order for a second strike came from Bradley, Leavitt said Bradley was \"well within his authority to do so.\" Catch up quick: The Washington Post recently reported that Hegseth ordered a second attack to kill survivors clinging to the wreckage. Hegseth has denied the accuracy of the report. The intrigue: The Defense Department's Law of War Manual uses shooting shipwrecked survivors as an example of an illegal order that service members are obligated to refuse. \"For example, orders to fire upon the shipwrecked would be clearly illegal,\" the manual states. When prompted by a reporter to explain how the strike is not an example of a war crime, Leavitt said the strike was \"conducted in international waters and in accordance with the law of armed conflict.\" Zoom in: Bradley is a Navy SEAL and the head of the United States Special Operations Command, according to his leadership bio . He completed his SEAL training in 1992, shortly after graduating from the Naval academy in '91. He's also done multiple tours in command of joint task forces and was among the first soldiers to deploy into Afghanistan after 9/11. State of play: Both the Senate and House Armed Services Committee chairs announced probes into the allegations this weekend. Leavitt also said the administration has conducted 13 bipartisan briefings to Congress and has allowed their offices to review classified legal opinions and other related documents. A bid to block Trump from unilaterally ordering the strikes failed in the Senate last month by a 49-51 vote. What we're watching: The administration has assembled thousands of boots on the ground and has fighter jets, early-warning aircraft, sub-hunters, and roughly 185 long-range Tomahawk missiles, according to independent estimations. Trump also hinted that the U.S. might shift to stopping drug traffickers on Venezuelan land \"very soon,\" but later clarified that reporters shouldn't read into his decision to close Venezuelan airspace as a sign of imminent action. Go deeper: Trump: US will stop alleged Venezuelan drug traffickers on land \"very soon\"",

    "snippet_raw": "Multiple bomb threats were received at Chuck Schumer's (D-N.Y.) offices across New York on Monday, the Senate minority leader announced in a statement. Driving the news: Schumer said his offices in Rochester, Binghamton and Long Island were targeted with bomb threats via emails with the subject line \"MAGA.\" The release said the threats came from \"an email address alleging the '2020 election was rigged.'\" Federal and local law enforcement responded and are conducting full security sweeps, the release said. Schumer added: \"Everyone is safe.\" The big picture: Concerns on Capitol Hill over member safety are at a fever pitch, following a disturbing string of political attacks and assassination attempts. Last month, Schumer said he asked the U.S. Capitol Police to give two Democratic senators — Sens. Mark Kelly (D-Az.) and Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) — \"special protection.\" The request came after Kelly and Slotkin clashed with President Trump over a video the pair appeared in urging service members to disobey unlawful orders. What they're saying: \" As I have said many times, these kinds of violent threats have absolutely no place in our political system,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"No one — no public servant, no staff member, no constituent, no citizen — should ever be targeted for simply doing their job.\"",

    "url": "https://www.axios.com/2025/12/01/hegseth-trump-military-boat-strikes-drug-venezuela",
    "snippet_raw": "The White House on Monday defended the legality of its strikes on suspected drug boats from Venezuela and the surrounding area following a Washington Post report that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a second attack on a ship to kill survivors. The big picture: Military experts warn the attacks could be illegal and lawmakers are demanding more information about the lethal strikes, which are often announced by President Trump or Hegseth on social media. The attacks have killed dozens so far. The strikes are a part of a broader pressure campaign on Venezuela and President Nicolás Maduro. The Department of Defense did not immediately respond to Axios' request for comment Monday. Here's a look at the military boat strikes we know about. Pre-strikes: Boats head to Venezuela In mid-August, the U.S. sent warships, spy planes, fighter jets, bombers and drones to the waters off Venezuela. This came after the U.S. increased the bounty on Maduro over alleged drug trafficking. The U.S. Navy cruiser USS Lake Erie docking at the Port of Balboa in Panama City on Aug. 29, as part of a broader U.S. naval buildup near Venezuela . Photo: Mauricio Valenzuela/AFP via Getty Images Strike 1: Pentagon's \"precision strike\" The Pentagon announced a \"precision strike against a drug vessel operated by a designated narco-terrorist organization\" on Sept. 2, kicking off Trump's campaign . Trump posted a video of an attack , saying it killed 11 alleged members of Tren de Aragua, a cartel based on Venezuela. Friction point: The Washington Post recently reported that the initial strike lit the boat on fire, but two survivors clung to the wreckage. The report alleges that Hegseth personally ordered a second strike to kill everyone aboard the boat. Hegseth denied the report's accuracy. Trump backed Hegseth on Sunday: \"The first strike was very lethal. It was fine. And if there were two people around, but Pete said that didn't happen,\" he said. \"I have great confidence.\" Reported death toll: 11 Strike 2 On Sept. 15, Trump announced that an attack that killed three people allegedly \"transporting illegal narcotics.\" . @POTUS “This morning, on my Orders, U.S. Military Forces conducted a SECOND Kinetic Strike against positively identified, extraordinarily violent drug trafficking cartels and narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.

    "url": "https://www.axios.com/2025/12/01/trump-hegseth-venezuela-strike-order",
    "snippet_raw": "President Trump said he believes Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's denial of a report alleging he ordered military forces to leave no survivors in a strike on a suspected drug trafficking boat from Venezuela. The big picture: The U.S. has ramped up its military pressure on Venezuela and President Nicolás Maduro despite legal experts and lawmakers sounding the alarm over the legality of the strikes on alleged drug traffickers that have killed dozens. Hegseth slammed The Washington Post's report that he directed military officials to kill everyone aboard a vessel, which allegedly resulted in a second strike to take out two survivors. The Intercept also previously reported on the follow-up attack. He dismissed the allegations as \"fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory\" on X but said \"these highly effective strikes are specifically intended to be 'lethal, kinetic strikes.'\" Driving the news: \"He said he did not say that, and I believe him 100%,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday. The president added that \"we'll look into it\" and that he wouldn't have wanted a second strike. \"The first strike was very lethal. It was fine. And if there were two people around, but Pete said that didn't happen,\" he said. \"I have great confidence.\" Trump added, \"Pete said he did not order the death of those two men,\" Friction point: But lawmakers have expressed increasing concern over the shadowy operations and are seeking to conduct their own oversight of the strikes. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) and Ranking Member Adam Smith (D-Wash.) said in a Saturday statement that they \"take seriously\" the reports of follow-up strikes and are \"taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question.\" Similarly, Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Ranking Member Jack Reed (D-R.I.) said in a statement the committee will conduct \"vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.\" What they're saying: Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" Sunday that if the allegations are proven true, \"this rises to the level of a war crime.\" Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio), the former chair of the House Intelligence Committee, also said on CBS that there \"are very serious concerns in Congress about the attacks on the so-called drug boats down in the Caribbean and the Pacific, and the legal justification that's been provided\" How he responded: After lawmakers aired their concerns on the morning political show circuit, Hegseth took to his personal account Sunday evening to share an image of the children's cartoon turtle Franklin firing a weapon at what appear to be drug-smuggling boats. \"For your Christmas wish list...\" he wrote. What we're watching: Trump signaled Thursday that the squeeze on Venezuela will only tighten, saying that land operations will start \"very soon.\" Days later, he issued a broad directive on Truth Social declaring the airspace above and surrounding Venezuela \"CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY,\" which the Venezuelan government castigated as a \"hostile, unilateral, and arbitrary act.\" Asked Sunday whether his statement about the country's airspace signaled an imminent airstrike, Trump replied, \"Don't read anything into it.\" Go deeper: What to know about the military forces Trump is assembling near Venezuela",

    "title": "Behind the Curtain: Volatility vortex",
    "url": "https://www.axios.com/2025/12/01/american-politics-volatility-trump",
    "snippet_raw": "Every president back to Bill Clinton enjoyed full party control of Congress and fantasized about lasting, durable governing dominance. Every president back to Bill Clinton lost it within two years . Why it matters: Nothing captures the volatility of American politics better than this win-big, lose-quick phenomenon. It's like a new law of political gravity: What the swing voter giveth, the swing voter abruptly taketh away. President Trump would need to defy gravity to avoid the same fate that hit him during his first term … and hit Joe Biden … and Barack Obama … and George W. Bush … and Clinton. The big picture: We've been telling readers for a decade to expect whiplash political volatility for the foreseeable future. This makes business planning more difficult because the regulatory, political and economic policy environments shift so quickly and dramatically. Both parties are prisoners to three stubborn political dynamics and realities: America is roughly a 33-33-33 nation. Roughly a third of voters are die-hard Democrats, and another third are die-hard Republicans. The other third (or slightly more) are perpetually open-minded and persistently dissatisfied with the new party in power. This dynamic has held firm for most of the past 30 years and shows no obvious signs of shifting. Almost every election since Clinton has flipped control of the White House or Congress. The number of truly competitive House races is shockingly small — roughly 10% of the 435 House seats, give or take. You can thank redistricting at the state level for meticulously chopping the nation into safe havens for very partisan Republicans or Democrats. That means the most important races are often primaries, where voter turnout is low and dominated by activists. Hence, the dominance of hyperpartisans. Big new policies take years to work their way into Americans' actual lives. Trump's tax cut bill, or Biden's infrastructure and green energy laws, or Obamacare were all substantial wins for the party in power. But any benefits usually take longer for voters to feel than the time left in a two-year election cycle. So, like clockwork, a new party wins power, feels invincible, believes it'll defy gravity, obsesses about those hyperpartisans who vote in primaries — and ticks off both swing voters and the activists on the other side. And then loses again. What we're watching: The American electorate is so volatile that there are now scenarios in which the GOP could lose its House majority even before next year's midterms. Axios told you last week that rising security fears , and even death threats, — along with MAGA infighting — are fueling the once-unthinkable conversation among House Republicans about quitting Congress early. \"It's no longer an exaggeration to say that House Republicans could lose their majority during this Congress\" if Speaker Mike Johnson loses another House Republican to resignation, death or illness, Punchbowl notes . \"Whether Republicans agree or not, their majority is slipping away.\" In a Gallup poll out Friday, Republican approval of Congress (controlled by, um, Republicans) is an atrocious 23% — halved from a pre-shutdown 54% in September, and down from 63% in March. Image: Bruce Mehlman's \"Six-Chart Sunday\" Watch that pendulum: This thought-provoking graphic — part of the 100th issue of strategist Bruce Mehlman's always-useful \" Six-Chart Sunday \" — reminds America's powerful that they and their ideas could be on the outs soon enough. \"In politics and life,\" Mehlman writes, \"playing the long game means minding your reputation for honesty & reliability, dealing squarely with a wide array of stakeholders, doing unto others as you'd have done to you and critically, remaining bipartisan … because the pendulum always swings back.\" Mehlman reminds us that so far this century, 11 of 13 U.S. elections were \"change elections,\" in which voters tossed out the party controlling the House, Senate or White House — a volatility streak unseen since the late 1800s , during the Gilded Age . \"Demand for change is strongest from the out party and its activists — the so-called ' thermostatic ' effect,\" Mehlman told us. Flashback: In a column back in February, we reminded Republicans of the \"payback precedent\": \"Copy the payback, punishments and precedent-shattering techniques practiced by the other party — if they prove effective. ... Republicans should fully expect future Democratic presidents to use and build on all [President Trump's] norm-busting moves.\" And back in June, Zachary Basu helped us chart the 10 \" unprecedented new precedents \" for presidential power that House and Senate Republicans have enabled. The bottom line: Trump might be different. But that's what first-term Trump — and Biden, Obama, Bush and Clinton — all thought, too. Go deeper ... Behind the Curtain: Big red alert .",

    "url": "https://www.axios.com/2025/12/01/bill-gates-sun-climate-change",
    "snippet_raw": "Bill Gates says he would support deploying artificial cooling technologies to lower global temperatures — but only if the planet hits so-called climate tipping points. Why it matters : The Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist is a major funder of research into this controversial technology, and his comments in a recent interview with Axios are among his most expansive yet. Activity by startups has sparked a wave of media attention to the tech, which is known as geoengineering. Coverage includes The New Yorker , The Atlantic and Politico magazine during November alone. The big picture : Solar radiation management — reflecting more of the sun's energy back into space — is a subset of geoengineering that's shifting from fringe science and conspiracy theory into mainstream policy debate. The idea could help blunt extreme weather , but its risks remain uncertain and likely significant. How it works: Solar radiation management, or solar geoengineering, aims to cool the planet by reflecting sunlight. The most-discussed method involves injecting sulfuric-acid particles into the upper atmosphere, mimicking the cooling effect of volcanic eruptions. Driving the news: Gates' comments, made during an interview last month at Caltech, are significant because he makes a distinction between what's become a more common position — supporting research into geoengineering — versus actually deploying it. Zoom out: In the interview, Gates said the world is largely on track to avoid the worst climate impacts thanks to rising clean-energy deployment. But he emphasized there's still an outlier chance of especially dire consequences driven in part by tipping points — scenarios in which warming triggers reinforcing feedbacks, or secondary effects, which accelerate climate change. You \"would then need to reach for some other type of intervention,\" Gates said. When asked whether that meant geoengineering — and whether he would support its deployment in such a scenario — Gates replied: \"Yes, I've been a funder of trying to understand geoengineering.\" Much of his funding isn't publicly disclosed, but what is known includes past support for Harvard University's solar geoengineering program. Context: Gates stressed the difference between supporting research and advocating deployment. \"No way am I pushing the world in that direction,\" he said, before adding that having knowledge about it could be \"quite valuable.\" Friction point: \"There are two big arguments against it, which are both legitimate and need to be considered,\" Gates said. Political: Relying on solar geoengineering could undermine efforts to cut fossil-fuel use. \"That's terrible if that slows that down,\" he said. Scientific: Researchers need a clear understanding of how injected particles would affect communities, including risks of altered rainfall or drought. The intrigue: Conspiracy theorists — who have targeted Gates for years — have focused on geoengineering as well , fueling political backlash. Such theories are a major driver of state-level bans and prompted Trump administration investigations. Catch up fast : Israel-based Stardust Solutions disclosed a $60 million fundraising round in October. That raised alarms about whether private companies should be able to act independently on such a consequential technology. Zoom out : At this year's United Nations climate summit in Brazil, leaders acknowledged for the first time that the world is on track to exceed temperature thresholds associated with especially severe impacts. Those conditions could trigger the kinds of tipping points under which Gates said he could support deploying geoengineering. Scientists say such scenarios are likely decades away, even as extreme weather worsens today. The bottom line: \"In some ways, that's the least confrontational framing\" on geoengineering, said Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, about Gates' comments. \"It doesn't remove all the thorny questions, but it's probably the most defensible approach to take today.\" Disclosure: Amy Harder is the former founding executive editor of Cipher News, an independent news outlet supported by Bill Gates' climate and energy initiative Breakthrough Energy.

He’s struggling to perform, as if his private life is letting slip some fundamental doubt about his role in Africa. There’s a good dose of self-flagellation about western paternalism and hypocrisy in Pedro Pinho’s fifth feature, but it’s smart enough to know that this hand-wringing, extended over three hours, is yet another form of white man’s privilege. First seen driving through a sand blizzard like one of Antonioni’s existential wanderers, Sérgio seems to want to avoid thinking about the power dynamics at play around him. Being “here now”, in the moment, is his superpower – as he tells Gui (Jonathan Guilherme), the lofty Brazilian drag queen he dallies with. Gui’s gender-fluid posse, who hang out at the bar run by market hustler Diara (Cleo Diára), is a racial and sexual utopia ready to accept anyone, including this white expat.

    "snippet_raw": "Through static compositions and observational detail, the documentary explores how Laos’s visitors and residents inhabit the same spaces in very different ways Shot in Laos, Kimi Takesue’s idiosyncratic documentary gazes upon sights and vistas that would not be out of place on travel postcards. Minimal in its camera movements, the film looks at glimmering golden temples, waterfalls cascading down silver rocks, and processions of monks moving through lush landscapes. It also shows what is absent from glossy brochures, namely the intrusion of tourists. The disruption to the local rhythm of life is at once visual and aural: we see throngs of wandering visitors, their casual clothes of shorts and T-shirts a stark contrast to the ancient architecture. Their occasionally rowdy leisure activities are intercut with more mundane moments from the locals’ everyday lives, like schoolchildren heading to class or laywomen offering alms to monks by the roadside. There’s a sense of tension between the static camera and the movements that occur within the frame. Scenes of tourists being loaded on to buses bring to mind Jacques Tati’s 1967 classic Playtime, which gently pokes fun at the idea of an authentic cultural experience attained via consumerist means. The point of view in Takesue’s film, however, is on shakier grounds. Some of the visual juxtapositions veer towards reiterating well-worn binaries between the east and west, the regional and the global. For instance, most of the tourists seen in Onlookers are white; in truth, visitors to Laos largely come from neighbouring Asian countries. Likewise, the Laotian population is also far from homogeneous: one sequence shows middle-aged men playing a game of catch, with the caption telling us they are “arguing in Lao” – yet some of them are speaking Vietnamese.

The onslaught continues. There are near-daily attacks on the territory . On a single day at the end of October, almost 100 Palestinians were killed. On 19 November, 32 were killed. On 23 November, 21. And on it goes. Since the ceasefire, more than 300 have been killed and almost 1,000 injured. Those numbers will rise. The real shift is that the ceasefire has reduced global attention and scrutiny. Meanwhile, Israel’s emerging blueprint becomes clearer: bloody domination not only in Gaza, but across Palestine and the wider region. A “dangerous illusion that life in Gaza is returning to normal”, is how Amnesty International’s secretary general, Agnès Callamard, described this post-ceasefire period. Israeli authorities have reduced attacks and allowed some aid into Gaza, she said, but “the world must not be fooled. Israel’s genocide is not over.” Not a single hospital in Gaza has returned to being fully operational. The onset of rain and cooling weather has left thousands exposed in dilapidated tents. Since the ceasefire on 10 October, almost 6,500 tonnes of UN-coordinated relief materials have been denied entry into Gaza by Israeli authorities. According to Oxfam , in the two weeks after the ceasefire alone, shipments of water, food, tents and medical supplies from 17 international NGOs were denied. Continue reading...",

Sarah Beckstrom , who died of her injuries, to the White House. \"I said, 'When you're ready,' because that's a tough thing, 'come to the White House; we're going to honor Sarah,'\" the president said . \"And likewise with Andrew, recover or not,\" Trump said of Beckstrom's 24-year-old colleague, Andrew Wolfe , who was critically injured in the attack. The big picture: Communities in West Virginia have in recent days been honoring the National Guard members, with state Gov. Patrick Morrisey issuing a proclamation requesting West Virginians to \"observe a statewide moment of silence or prayer\" on Friday. Morrisey told Fox News on Sunday that he had visited Wolfe in the hospital a day earlier and he \"is still in critical condition, he's fighting for his life.\" The suspect in the shooting near the White House faces charges including one count of first-degree murder .

    "url": "https://www.axios.com/2025/11/30/venezuela-boat-strikes-survivors-washington-post",
    "snippet_raw": "Trump allies Sunday pushed back on a Washington Post report that alleges Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth ordered additional strikes on survivors of attacks on suspected drug trafficking boats from Venezuela. Why it matters: Legal experts have warned that the attacks could be illegal as the Trump administration ramps up its military presence around Venezuela, placing pressure on President Nicolás Maduro. Catch up quick: The Washington Post reported Friday that Hegseth in September ordered a second strike to kill any survivors of a boat hit off the coast of Venezuela. Hegseth on X dismissed the reporting as \"fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory.\" CNN also reported on the alleged order Saturday. What they're saying: Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) dismissed the reporting as anonymous and unproven on CNN's State of the Union. \"I don't know if I believe that at all,\" he said. Mullin said the Navy and Coast Guard have rescued and returned survivors from other strikes. President Trump is \"protecting the Unites States by being proactive,\" Mullin said. \"I don't think [Hegseth] would be foolish enough to make this decision to say, 'Kill everybody. Kill the survivors.' Because that's a clear violation of the law of war,\" Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), a retired Air Force general, said on ABC's This Week. \"I'm very suspicious that he would have done something like that because it would go against common sense.\" Yes, but: \" If the facts go where the Washington Post article takes it, well then we'll have to go from there. If it was as if the article said, that is a violation of the article of war,\" Bacon said. Zoom out: House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) and Ranking Member Adam Smith (D-Wash.) issued a joint statement Saturday vowing \"rigorous oversight\" of the military strikes in the Caribbean. \"We take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question,\" they said. A congressional briefing on the strikes around the time of Hegseth's alleged order was abruptly canceled . The admiral overseeing the South American and Caribbean region stepped down in October. Attorney General Pam Bondi declined to discuss releasing an Office of Legal Council memo that provides legal justification for the attacks when asked about it on Fox News Sunday. But she did say, \"Venezuela drug dealers need to tread very, very carefully.\" Friction point: When asked, Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), a former Navy captain, said a second strike on survivors \"seems to\" be a war crime if the reports are accurate. \"I've got serious concerns about anybody in that chain of command stepping over a line they should never step over,\" he said on CNN's State of the Union. \"We're not Russia. We're not Iraq. We hold ourselves to a very high standard of professionalism.\" Kelly was one of six Democratic veterans who recorded a video reminding service members they should not follow illegal orders. The military is investigating Kelly for his participation in that video. \"I'm not backing down. They don't scare me,\" Kelly said. Worthy of your time: The Defense Department's Law of War Manual uses shooting shipwrecked survivors as an example of a clearly illegal order that service members are obligated to refuse. \"For example, orders to fire upon the shipwrecked would be clearly illegal,\" the manual says on page 1117. Editor's note: This story has been updated with comments from Rep. Don Bacon and additional information from the Defense Department Law of War Manual.",

    "url": "https://www.axios.com/2025/11/30/christians-empathy-jesus-immigration-politics",
    "snippet_raw": "As the U.S. grows more diverse, a quiet civil war is unfolding within American Christianity over who deserves empathy. Why it matters: Conservatives ranging from evangelical pastors to Elon Musk have started framing empathy not as a virtue but as a vulnerability on immigration , racial justice and LGBTQ+ rights. They are working to drive out school lessons on empathy and argue in books and sermons that empathy is for the weak or \"woke.\" Others say empathy is central to Christianity and the teachings of Jesus. This split comes as Christianity and organized religion are shrinking and the U.S. undergoes a profound demographic transformation: no single racial group will hold a majority within two decades. Zoom in: \"Empathy as hoisted up as the highest virtue — or even a virtue at all — gets us into a really big mess,\" conservative author Allie Beth Stuckey said on a \"Family Talk\" podcast . She wrote a book last year, \" Toxic Empathy : How Progressives Exploit Christian Compassion.\" \"Empathy is dangerous. Empathy is toxic. Empathy will align you with hell,\" pastor Josh McPherson, a conservative men's-ministry influencer, said on his \"Stronger Man Nation\" podcast. Pastor Joe Rigney, in his book, \" The Sin of Empathy: Compassion and Its Counterfeits,\" attacks empathy as spiritually dangerous. Elon Musk said on Joe Rogan's podcast this February that Western empathy toward the suffering of others is being \"weaponized\" and linked it to civilizational decline, even though he thought empathy was good. The big picture: Around 80% of U.S. adults said empathy was a moral value that underpinned a healthy society, according to the wide-ranging survey by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) in October. Only 16% said empathy was a dangerous emotion that undermines \"our ability to set up a society that is guided by God's truth,\" the poll found. The other side: \"In the Christian tradition, to have anybody argue that a spirit of empathy is somehow a vulnerability... is insane,\" Father Brendan Busse, pastor of Dolores Mission Catholic Church in Los Angeles, tells Axios. Busse said the suffering of Jesus on the Cross invokes empathy, as does the call to help \"the least of these\" in the Gospels. Empathy drives the mission of Homeboy Industries, the Los Angeles-based (and world's largest) gang intervention organization, founded by Catholic priest Greg Boyle. The North Carolina-based Repairers of the Breach , founded by Bishop William J. Barber II, uses empathy to fight poverty and economic inequality. Between the lines : Between 2021 and early 2023, legislators in at least 25 states introduced bills backed by conservatives intended to ban or restrict social-emotional learning (SEL) in K-12 schools. Social-emotional learning is an educational strategy that teaches empathy, cooperation and social skills. All SEL bans have failed to pass following opposition from educators and moderate Christians. The bottom line: The Bible gives conflicting messages on empathy, said Dan McClellan, a Biblical scholar and author of \" The Bible Says So: What We Get Right (and Wrong) About Scripture's Most Controversial Issues.\" On the one hand, McClellan said some stories in scripture speak of empathy only for your ethnic group and disregard others, like Joshua's passages about the walls of Jericho and the killing of innocent children. \"Then there's a universal empathy, where your empathy extends beyond your own group,\" McClellan said, pointing to the Beatitudes and Jesus' parable about the Good Samaritan.",
