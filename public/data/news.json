    "url": "https://www.axios.com/2025/12/01/fema-workers-criticizing-white-house",
    "snippet_raw": "The 14 FEMA employees who signed the so-called Katrina declaration went back to work for a little while Monday — but the Department of Homeland Security now says that should never have happened. Why it matters: A spokesperson for DHS told Axios in an email that their employees' reinstatement was unauthorized. \"CNN reporting revealed that 14 FEMA employees previously placed on leave for misconduct were wrongly and without authorization reinstated by bureaucrats acting outside of their authority,\" the department said in an email. \"Once alerted, the unauthorized reinstatement was swiftly corrected by senior leadership. The 14 employees who signed the Katrina declaration have been returned to administrative leave.\" Catch up quick: The employees were placed on leave this summer after signing the petition protesting the Trump administration's disaster response efforts. Dubbed the Katrina Declaration and sent to Congress in August, the petition warned that cuts to the agency were putting people and property at risk, and were a departure from improvements in disaster response put in place after the botched response to the devastating 2005 Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. Just one day after it was made public, the Department of Homeland Security put signers who had used their full names on indefinite leave — one employee was fired. The signers then filed complaints with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal agency that investigates whistleblower complaints. Zoom in: They received notices of their reinstatement last week, and were ordered to return to the office Monday. But by the afternoon, they received memos ordering them back on leave, said David Seide, senior counsel at the Government Accountability Project, a nonprofit group that helped workers file their complaints. \"It's appalling that the politicos have overruled the managers,\" he tells Axios. Zoom out: Previously in the day, Seide said the reinstatement would help his group make the case to reinstate other workers in similar situations. to argue for other government workers. \"I'd expect them to treat it as meaningful precedent.\" 144 employees at the EPA were put on leave in July, and seven were fired, after putting out a similar letter. Last month, the NIH placed Jenna Norton on leave. Norton signed a similar petition, deemed the \" Bethesda Declaration .\" The big picture: It's far more difficult to fire federal workers than those in the private sector — though the Trump administration has been pushing to change that. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been terminated or pushed out of work by the administration this year. Though a few efforts — like conducting layoffs during the shutdown — have been thwarted. Zoom out: President Trump has floated \"getting rid of\" FEMA in the past, and putting the responsibility for disaster relief more squarely in the hands of the states. But the White House backed away from that stance after devastating floods in Texas last summer. What they're saying: \"They were all so excited to return to work,\" says Colette Delawalla, CEO of Stand up for Science, a nonnprofit advocacy group started this year that's working with these employees. They're a group devoted to the mission of FEMA, she tells Axios. A few of them had been pulled from working on disaster relief efforts in Texas after deadly flooding there this summer. \"They're pretty upset now.\" More from Axios: Post-Katrina safeguards being eroded at FEMA, employees warn Multiple FEMA staff put on leave after letter criticizing Trump admin Editor's note: This article and the headline have been updated to reflect comment from the Department of Homeland Security saying the FEMA workers were wrongly reinstated, and it's been updated with comment from Stand up for Science CEO Colette Delawalla.",

    "title": "\"Bibi sees ghosts everywhere\": U.S. alarmed by Israel's Syria strikes",
    "url": "https://www.axios.com/2025/12/01/israel-syria-strikes-trump-netanyahu",
    "snippet_raw": "The Trump administration is concerned that Israel's repeated strikes inside Syria risk destabilizing the country and undermining hopes of an Israel-Syria security agreement, two senior U.S. officials tell Axios. \"We are trying to tell Bibi he has to stop this because if it continues he will self-destruct,\" one of those officials said, referring to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by his nickname. The big picture: Supporting President Ahmed al-Sharaa's efforts to stabilize Syria and encouraging him to engage in a peace process with Israel are key elements of the Trump administration's Middle East strategy. President Trump and his team have repeatedly sided with Syria's government in disputes with Israel— the only country in the region for which that's the case. On Monday, Trump posted on Truth Social in support of al-Sharaa and said it was \"very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria's evolution into a prosperous State.\" The U.S. officials made clear they think Netanyahu is interfering in very unhelpful ways. He has ordered military action across the border in Syria on several occasions, including in the past few days. Driving the news: Israeli forces conducting a raid less than 10 miles into Syrian territory on Friday came under fire from unknown gunmen after arresting suspected militants, with six Israeli soldiers injured, according to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). While trying to extract its forces, the IDF unleashed airstrikes that killed 13 Syrians, many of them civilians. The raid and airstrikes — which took place beyond the portion of Syrian territory Israel has been occupying since the fall of the Assad regime — enraged the Syrian government and generated calls from inside Syria for retaliation. \"The Syrians were going nuts. Their own constituents demanded retaliation because Syrian civilians were killed,\" a U.S. official said. Behind the scenes: The U.S. officials told Axios the White House did not receive prior notice of the Israeli operation, and that the Israelis didn't warn Syria through military channels as they have in past cases. Israeli officials claimed the suspects were were part of a group affiliated with Hamas and Hezbollah and had planned attacks against Israel, and that Israel informed the Syrians through intelligence channels. Friction point: U.S. officials working on Middle East issues have fumed for months at what they see as Netanyahu's shoot first, ask questions later approach to Syria. \"Syria doesn't want problems with Israel. This isn't Lebanon,\" a senior U.S. official said, drawing a distinction between Israel's recent strikes in the two countries. \"But Bibi is seeing ghosts everywhere.\" \"We are trying to tell Bibi he has to stop this because if it continues he will self-destruct — miss a huge diplomatic opportunity and turn the new Syrian government to an enemy,\" the official continued. This isn't the first time such sentiments have bubbled up. After Israel's brazen strikes on Damascus in June, a White House official told Axios: \"Bibi acted like a madman. He bombs everything all the time. This could undermine what Trump is trying to do.\" The other side: Trump's embrace of al-Sharaa, a former al-Qaeda commander, has worried the Israelis. They were shocked when Trump met the rebel-turned-president last May in Saudi Arabia, and uncomfortable with the chumminess between the two during their historic Oval Office meeting this month. The Israelis also objected to Trump's decision to lift U.S. sanctions on Syria. While the Israelis have engaged with U.S. efforts to advance an Israel-Syria security pact, they've done so warily and presented maximalist demands. State of play: Two U.S. officials told Axios that Netanyahu's actions had now partially undermined work on a deal, which Washington hopes will be the first step to Syria joining the Abraham Accords at a later date. Since Friday, U.S. envoy to Syria Tom Barrack and other Trump administration officials have held tense conversations with their Israeli counterparts on that topic. U.S. officials held similar talks to try to calm down the Syrians and avoid further escalation. On Monday, Barrack met al-Sharaa in Damascus. The U.S. officials said it's not clear who holds the Syria file in Israel's government after the resignation of Netanyahu's confidant Ron Dermer. The latest: On Monday, Trump weighed in publicly with the Truth Social post praising al-Sharaa and cautioning Israel. Trump spoke with Netanyahu shortly after the post, though the Israeli readout said Trump had invited Netanyahu to D.C. and didn't mention Syria.",

    "url": "https://www.axios.com/2025/12/01/pete-hegseth-venezuelan-boat-survivors-strike",
    "snippet_raw": "A Navy admiral and not Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed a September strike on a suspected drug boat near Venezuela where the military was reportedly ordered to kill survivors, the White House said Monday. Why it matters: The White House defended the legality of the attack, but Congress has vowed to investigate with some members warning that, if substantiated , the deaths could violate the laws of war. What they're saying: \"On Sept. 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Admiral [Frank] Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a news briefing. \"Admiral Bradley worked well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated.\" In response to a question asking her to confirm that an order for a second strike came from Bradley, Leavitt said Bradley was \"well within his authority to do so.\" Catch up quick: The Washington Post recently reported that Hegseth ordered a second attack to kill survivors clinging to the wreckage. Hegseth has denied the accuracy of the report. The intrigue: The Defense Department's Law of War Manual uses shooting shipwrecked survivors as an example of an illegal order that service members are obligated to refuse. \"For example, orders to fire upon the shipwrecked would be clearly illegal,\" the manual states. When prompted by a reporter to explain how the strike is not an example of a war crime, Leavitt said the strike was \"conducted in international waters and in accordance with the law of armed conflict.\" Zoom in: Bradley is a Navy SEAL and the head of the United States Special Operations Command, according to his leadership bio . He completed his SEAL training in 1992, shortly after graduating from the Naval academy in '91. He's also done multiple tours in command of joint task forces and was among the first soldiers to deploy into Afghanistan after 9/11. State of play: Both the Senate and House Armed Services Committee chairs announced probes into the allegations this weekend. Leavitt also said the administration has conducted 13 bipartisan briefings to Congress and has allowed their offices to review classified legal opinions and other related documents. A bid to block Trump from unilaterally ordering the strikes failed in the Senate last month by a 49-51 vote. What we're watching: The administration has assembled thousands of boots on the ground and has fighter jets, early-warning aircraft, sub-hunters, and roughly 185 long-range Tomahawk missiles, according to independent estimations. Trump also hinted that the U.S. might shift to stopping drug traffickers on Venezuelan land \"very soon,\" but later clarified that reporters shouldn't read into his decision to close Venezuelan airspace as a sign of imminent action. Go deeper: Trump: US will stop alleged Venezuelan drug traffickers on land \"very soon\"",

    "snippet_raw": "Multiple bomb threats were received at Chuck Schumer's (D-N.Y.) offices across New York on Monday, the Senate minority leader announced in a statement. Driving the news: Schumer said his offices in Rochester, Binghamton and Long Island were targeted with bomb threats via emails with the subject line \"MAGA.\" The release said the threats came from \"an email address alleging the '2020 election was rigged.'\" Federal and local law enforcement responded and are conducting full security sweeps, the release said. Schumer added: \"Everyone is safe.\" The big picture: Concerns on Capitol Hill over member safety are at a fever pitch, following a disturbing string of political attacks and assassination attempts. Last month, Schumer said he asked the U.S. Capitol Police to give two Democratic senators — Sens. Mark Kelly (D-Az.) and Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) — \"special protection.\" The request came after Kelly and Slotkin clashed with President Trump over a video the pair appeared in urging service members to disobey unlawful orders. What they're saying: \" As I have said many times, these kinds of violent threats have absolutely no place in our political system,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"No one — no public servant, no staff member, no constituent, no citizen — should ever be targeted for simply doing their job.\"",

    "url": "https://www.axios.com/2025/12/01/hegseth-trump-military-boat-strikes-drug-venezuela",
    "snippet_raw": "The White House on Monday defended the legality of its strikes on suspected drug boats from Venezuela and the surrounding area following a Washington Post report that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a second attack on a ship to kill survivors. The big picture: Military experts warn the attacks could be illegal and lawmakers are demanding more information about the lethal strikes, which are often announced by President Trump or Hegseth on social media. The attacks have killed dozens so far. The strikes are a part of a broader pressure campaign on Venezuela and President Nicolás Maduro. The Department of Defense did not immediately respond to Axios' request for comment Monday. Here's a look at the military boat strikes we know about. Pre-strikes: Boats head to Venezuela In mid-August, the U.S. sent warships, spy planes, fighter jets, bombers and drones to the waters off Venezuela. This came after the U.S. increased the bounty on Maduro over alleged drug trafficking. The U.S. Navy cruiser USS Lake Erie docking at the Port of Balboa in Panama City on Aug. 29, as part of a broader U.S. naval buildup near Venezuela . Photo: Mauricio Valenzuela/AFP via Getty Images Strike 1: Pentagon's \"precision strike\" The Pentagon announced a \"precision strike against a drug vessel operated by a designated narco-terrorist organization\" on Sept. 2, kicking off Trump's campaign . Trump posted a video of an attack , saying it killed 11 alleged members of Tren de Aragua, a cartel based on Venezuela. Friction point: The Washington Post recently reported that the initial strike lit the boat on fire, but two survivors clung to the wreckage. The report alleges that Hegseth personally ordered a second strike to kill everyone aboard the boat. Hegseth denied the report's accuracy. Trump backed Hegseth on Sunday: \"The first strike was very lethal. It was fine. And if there were two people around, but Pete said that didn't happen,\" he said. \"I have great confidence.\" Reported death toll: 11 Strike 2 On Sept. 15, Trump announced that an attack that killed three people allegedly \"transporting illegal narcotics.\" . @POTUS “This morning, on my Orders, U.S. Military Forces conducted a SECOND Kinetic Strike against positively identified, extraordinarily violent drug trafficking cartels and narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.

Yet a short boat ride down the river from Belém, into the forest itself, takes you to another forest-dwelling community also fighting for further recognition within the Cop process. The quilombola community of Menino Jesus has existed for six generations. Quilombolas are the descendants of former enslaved people who fled into the forest as a site of refuge. Over hundreds of years, they established a unique way of life separate from mainstream Brazilian society, living in harmony with nature as fugitives protected by the jungle. Continue reading...",

    "url": "https://www.axios.com/2025/12/01/trump-hegseth-venezuela-strike-order",
    "snippet_raw": "President Trump said he believes Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's denial of a report alleging he ordered military forces to leave no survivors in a strike on a suspected drug trafficking boat from Venezuela. The big picture: The U.S. has ramped up its military pressure on Venezuela and President Nicolás Maduro despite legal experts and lawmakers sounding the alarm over the legality of the strikes on alleged drug traffickers that have killed dozens. Hegseth slammed The Washington Post's report that he directed military officials to kill everyone aboard a vessel, which allegedly resulted in a second strike to take out two survivors. The Intercept also previously reported on the follow-up attack. He dismissed the allegations as \"fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory\" on X but said \"these highly effective strikes are specifically intended to be 'lethal, kinetic strikes.'\" Driving the news: \"He said he did not say that, and I believe him 100%,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday. The president added that \"we'll look into it\" and that he wouldn't have wanted a second strike. \"The first strike was very lethal. It was fine. And if there were two people around, but Pete said that didn't happen,\" he said. \"I have great confidence.\" Trump added, \"Pete said he did not order the death of those two men,\" Friction point: But lawmakers have expressed increasing concern over the shadowy operations and are seeking to conduct their own oversight of the strikes. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) and Ranking Member Adam Smith (D-Wash.) said in a Saturday statement that they \"take seriously\" the reports of follow-up strikes and are \"taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question.\" Similarly, Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Ranking Member Jack Reed (D-R.I.) said in a statement the committee will conduct \"vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.\" What they're saying: Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" Sunday that if the allegations are proven true, \"this rises to the level of a war crime.\" Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio), the former chair of the House Intelligence Committee, also said on CBS that there \"are very serious concerns in Congress about the attacks on the so-called drug boats down in the Caribbean and the Pacific, and the legal justification that's been provided\" How he responded: After lawmakers aired their concerns on the morning political show circuit, Hegseth took to his personal account Sunday evening to share an image of the children's cartoon turtle Franklin firing a weapon at what appear to be drug-smuggling boats. \"For your Christmas wish list...\" he wrote. What we're watching: Trump signaled Thursday that the squeeze on Venezuela will only tighten, saying that land operations will start \"very soon.\" Days later, he issued a broad directive on Truth Social declaring the airspace above and surrounding Venezuela \"CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY,\" which the Venezuelan government castigated as a \"hostile, unilateral, and arbitrary act.\" Asked Sunday whether his statement about the country's airspace signaled an imminent airstrike, Trump replied, \"Don't read anything into it.\" Go deeper: What to know about the military forces Trump is assembling near Venezuela",

    "title": "Behind the Curtain: Volatility vortex",
    "url": "https://www.axios.com/2025/12/01/american-politics-volatility-trump",
    "snippet_raw": "Every president back to Bill Clinton enjoyed full party control of Congress and fantasized about lasting, durable governing dominance. Every president back to Bill Clinton lost it within two years . Why it matters: Nothing captures the volatility of American politics better than this win-big, lose-quick phenomenon. It's like a new law of political gravity: What the swing voter giveth, the swing voter abruptly taketh away. President Trump would need to defy gravity to avoid the same fate that hit him during his first term … and hit Joe Biden … and Barack Obama … and George W. Bush … and Clinton. The big picture: We've been telling readers for a decade to expect whiplash political volatility for the foreseeable future. This makes business planning more difficult because the regulatory, political and economic policy environments shift so quickly and dramatically. Both parties are prisoners to three stubborn political dynamics and realities: America is roughly a 33-33-33 nation. Roughly a third of voters are die-hard Democrats, and another third are die-hard Republicans. The other third (or slightly more) are perpetually open-minded and persistently dissatisfied with the new party in power. This dynamic has held firm for most of the past 30 years and shows no obvious signs of shifting. Almost every election since Clinton has flipped control of the White House or Congress. The number of truly competitive House races is shockingly small — roughly 10% of the 435 House seats, give or take. You can thank redistricting at the state level for meticulously chopping the nation into safe havens for very partisan Republicans or Democrats. That means the most important races are often primaries, where voter turnout is low and dominated by activists. Hence, the dominance of hyperpartisans. Big new policies take years to work their way into Americans' actual lives. Trump's tax cut bill, or Biden's infrastructure and green energy laws, or Obamacare were all substantial wins for the party in power. But any benefits usually take longer for voters to feel than the time left in a two-year election cycle. So, like clockwork, a new party wins power, feels invincible, believes it'll defy gravity, obsesses about those hyperpartisans who vote in primaries — and ticks off both swing voters and the activists on the other side. And then loses again. What we're watching: The American electorate is so volatile that there are now scenarios in which the GOP could lose its House majority even before next year's midterms. Axios told you last week that rising security fears , and even death threats, — along with MAGA infighting — are fueling the once-unthinkable conversation among House Republicans about quitting Congress early. \"It's no longer an exaggeration to say that House Republicans could lose their majority during this Congress\" if Speaker Mike Johnson loses another House Republican to resignation, death or illness, Punchbowl notes . \"Whether Republicans agree or not, their majority is slipping away.\" In a Gallup poll out Friday, Republican approval of Congress (controlled by, um, Republicans) is an atrocious 23% — halved from a pre-shutdown 54% in September, and down from 63% in March. Image: Bruce Mehlman's \"Six-Chart Sunday\" Watch that pendulum: This thought-provoking graphic — part of the 100th issue of strategist Bruce Mehlman's always-useful \" Six-Chart Sunday \" — reminds America's powerful that they and their ideas could be on the outs soon enough. \"In politics and life,\" Mehlman writes, \"playing the long game means minding your reputation for honesty & reliability, dealing squarely with a wide array of stakeholders, doing unto others as you'd have done to you and critically, remaining bipartisan … because the pendulum always swings back.\" Mehlman reminds us that so far this century, 11 of 13 U.S. elections were \"change elections,\" in which voters tossed out the party controlling the House, Senate or White House — a volatility streak unseen since the late 1800s , during the Gilded Age . \"Demand for change is strongest from the out party and its activists — the so-called ' thermostatic ' effect,\" Mehlman told us. Flashback: In a column back in February, we reminded Republicans of the \"payback precedent\": \"Copy the payback, punishments and precedent-shattering techniques practiced by the other party — if they prove effective. ... Republicans should fully expect future Democratic presidents to use and build on all [President Trump's] norm-busting moves.\" And back in June, Zachary Basu helped us chart the 10 \" unprecedented new precedents \" for presidential power that House and Senate Republicans have enabled. The bottom line: Trump might be different. But that's what first-term Trump — and Biden, Obama, Bush and Clinton — all thought, too. Go deeper ... Behind the Curtain: Big red alert .",

    "title": "Here's what would make Bill Gates support dimming the sun to stop climate change",
    "url": "https://www.axios.com/2025/12/01/bill-gates-sun-climate-change",
    "snippet_raw": "Bill Gates says he would support deploying artificial cooling technologies to lower global temperatures — but only if the planet hits so-called climate tipping points. Why it matters : The Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist is a major funder of research into this controversial technology, and his comments in a recent interview with Axios are among his most expansive yet. Activity by startups has sparked a wave of media attention to the tech, which is known as geoengineering. Coverage includes The New Yorker , The Atlantic and Politico magazine during November alone. The big picture : Solar radiation management — reflecting more of the sun's energy back into space — is a subset of geoengineering that's shifting from fringe science and conspiracy theory into mainstream policy debate. The idea could help blunt extreme weather , but its risks remain uncertain and likely significant. How it works: Solar radiation management, or solar geoengineering, aims to cool the planet by reflecting sunlight. The most-discussed method involves injecting sulfuric-acid particles into the upper atmosphere, mimicking the cooling effect of volcanic eruptions. Driving the news: Gates' comments, made during an interview last month at Caltech, are significant because he makes a distinction between what's become a more common position — supporting research into geoengineering — versus actually deploying it. Zoom out: In the interview, Gates said the world is largely on track to avoid the worst climate impacts thanks to rising clean-energy deployment. But he emphasized there's still an outlier chance of especially dire consequences driven in part by tipping points — scenarios in which warming triggers reinforcing feedbacks, or secondary effects, which accelerate climate change. You \"would then need to reach for some other type of intervention,\" Gates said. When asked whether that meant geoengineering — and whether he would support its deployment in such a scenario — Gates replied: \"Yes, I've been a funder of trying to understand geoengineering.\" Much of his funding isn't publicly disclosed, but what is known includes past support for Harvard University's solar geoengineering program. Context: Gates stressed the difference between supporting research and advocating deployment. \"No way am I pushing the world in that direction,\" he said, before adding that having knowledge about it could be \"quite valuable.\" Friction point: \"There are two big arguments against it, which are both legitimate and need to be considered,\" Gates said. Political: Relying on solar geoengineering could undermine efforts to cut fossil-fuel use. \"That's terrible if that slows that down,\" he said. Scientific: Researchers need a clear understanding of how injected particles would affect communities, including risks of altered rainfall or drought. The intrigue: Conspiracy theorists — who have targeted Gates for years — have focused on geoengineering as well , fueling political backlash. Such theories are a major driver of state-level bans and prompted Trump administration investigations. Catch up fast : Israel-based Stardust Solutions disclosed a $60 million fundraising round in October. That raised alarms about whether private companies should be able to act independently on such a consequential technology. Zoom out : At this year's United Nations climate summit in Brazil, leaders acknowledged for the first time that the world is on track to exceed temperature thresholds associated with especially severe impacts. Those conditions could trigger the kinds of tipping points under which Gates said he could support deploying geoengineering. Scientists say such scenarios are likely decades away, even as extreme weather worsens today. The bottom line: \"In some ways, that's the least confrontational framing\" on geoengineering, said Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, about Gates' comments. \"It doesn't remove all the thorny questions, but it's probably the most defensible approach to take today.\" Disclosure: Amy Harder is the former founding executive editor of Cipher News, an independent news outlet supported by Bill Gates' climate and energy initiative Breakthrough Energy.

He’s struggling to perform, as if his private life is letting slip some fundamental doubt about his role in Africa. There’s a good dose of self-flagellation about western paternalism and hypocrisy in Pedro Pinho’s fifth feature, but it’s smart enough to know that this hand-wringing, extended over three hours, is yet another form of white man’s privilege.

Gui’s gender-fluid posse, who hang out at the bar run by market hustler Diara (Cleo Diára), is a racial and sexual utopia ready to accept anyone, including this white expat.

This photographic report offers a rare glimpse into the tensions tearing the country apart Three years after the end of the Tigray war, Ethiopia is grappling with a violent armed insurgency devastating the north-west of the country. The Fano, an ethno-nationalist militia composed mainly of former soldiers from the Ethiopian regional special forces, now control large areas of the Amhara region. Abuses committed by federal forces in an attempt to quell the insurgency are widespread: kidnappings, massacres, sexual violence, and attacks on humanitarian personnel. The situation is out of control, and more than 2 million people are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance in a region that is also hosting refugees from the war in Sudan. Landscapes in the Lasta mountains, in Ethiopia’s Amhara region. This area spans a vast mountainous and hilly zone, bordering Tigray and Sudan. Its geography, typical of the Ethiopian highlands, offered a strategic position to the early kingdoms, making it the country’s main political, economic, and religious centre for centuries.

    "snippet_raw": "Through static compositions and observational detail, the documentary explores how Laos’s visitors and residents inhabit the same spaces in very different ways Shot in Laos, Kimi Takesue’s idiosyncratic documentary gazes upon sights and vistas that would not be out of place on travel postcards. Minimal in its camera movements, the film looks at glimmering golden temples, waterfalls cascading down silver rocks, and processions of monks moving through lush landscapes. It also shows what is absent from glossy brochures, namely the intrusion of tourists. The disruption to the local rhythm of life is at once visual and aural: we see throngs of wandering visitors, their casual clothes of shorts and T-shirts a stark contrast to the ancient architecture. Their occasionally rowdy leisure activities are intercut with more mundane moments from the locals’ everyday lives, like schoolchildren heading to class or laywomen offering alms to monks by the roadside. There’s a sense of tension between the static camera and the movements that occur within the frame. Scenes of tourists being loaded on to buses bring to mind Jacques Tati’s 1967 classic Playtime, which gently pokes fun at the idea of an authentic cultural experience attained via consumerist means. The point of view in Takesue’s film, however, is on shakier grounds. Some of the visual juxtapositions veer towards reiterating well-worn binaries between the east and west, the regional and the global. For instance, most of the tourists seen in Onlookers are white; in truth, visitors to Laos largely come from neighbouring Asian countries. Likewise, the Laotian population is also far from homogeneous: one sequence shows middle-aged men playing a game of catch, with the caption telling us they are “arguing in Lao” – yet some of them are speaking Vietnamese.

The onslaught continues. There are near-daily attacks on the territory . On a single day at the end of October, almost 100 Palestinians were killed. On 19 November, 32 were killed. On 23 November, 21. And on it goes. Since the ceasefire, more than 300 have been killed and almost 1,000 injured. Those numbers will rise. The real shift is that the ceasefire has reduced global attention and scrutiny. Meanwhile, Israel’s emerging blueprint becomes clearer: bloody domination not only in Gaza, but across Palestine and the wider region. A “dangerous illusion that life in Gaza is returning to normal”, is how Amnesty International’s secretary general, Agnès Callamard, described this post-ceasefire period. Israeli authorities have reduced attacks and allowed some aid into Gaza, she said, but “the world must not be fooled. Israel’s genocide is not over.” Not a single hospital in Gaza has returned to being fully operational. The onset of rain and cooling weather has left thousands exposed in dilapidated tents. Since the ceasefire on 10 October, almost 6,500 tonnes of UN-coordinated relief materials have been denied entry into Gaza by Israeli authorities. According to Oxfam , in the two weeks after the ceasefire alone, shipments of water, food, tents and medical supplies from 17 international NGOs were denied. Continue reading...",

    "snippet_raw": "Trump allies Sunday pushed back on a Washington Post report that alleges Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth ordered additional strikes on survivors of attacks on suspected drug trafficking boats from Venezuela. Why it matters: Legal experts have warned that the attacks could be illegal as the Trump administration ramps up its military presence around Venezuela, placing pressure on President Nicolás Maduro. Catch up quick: The Washington Post reported Friday that Hegseth in September ordered a second strike to kill any survivors of a boat hit off the coast of Venezuela. Hegseth on X dismissed the reporting as \"fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory.\" CNN also reported on the alleged order Saturday. What they're saying: Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) dismissed the reporting as anonymous and unproven on CNN's State of the Union. \"I don't know if I believe that at all,\" he said. Mullin said the Navy and Coast Guard have rescued and returned survivors from other strikes. President Trump is \"protecting the Unites States by being proactive,\" Mullin said. \"I don't think [Hegseth] would be foolish enough to make this decision to say, 'Kill everybody. Kill the survivors.' Because that's a clear violation of the law of war,\" Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), a retired Air Force general, said on ABC's This Week. \"I'm very suspicious that he would have done something like that because it would go against common sense.\" Yes, but: \" If the facts go where the Washington Post article takes it, well then we'll have to go from there. If it was as if the article said, that is a violation of the article of war,\" Bacon said. Zoom out: House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) and Ranking Member Adam Smith (D-Wash.) issued a joint statement Saturday vowing \"rigorous oversight\" of the military strikes in the Caribbean. \"We take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question,\" they said. A congressional briefing on the strikes around the time of Hegseth's alleged order was abruptly canceled . The admiral overseeing the South American and Caribbean region stepped down in October. Attorney General Pam Bondi declined to discuss releasing an Office of Legal Council memo that provides legal justification for the attacks when asked about it on Fox News Sunday. But she did say, \"Venezuela drug dealers need to tread very, very carefully.\" Friction point: When asked, Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), a former Navy captain, said a second strike on survivors \"seems to\" be a war crime if the reports are accurate. \"I've got serious concerns about anybody in that chain of command stepping over a line they should never step over,\" he said on CNN's State of the Union. \"We're not Russia. We're not Iraq. We hold ourselves to a very high standard of professionalism.\" Kelly was one of six Democratic veterans who recorded a video reminding service members they should not follow illegal orders. The military is investigating Kelly for his participation in that video. \"I'm not backing down. They don't scare me,\" Kelly said. Worthy of your time: The Defense Department's Law of War Manual uses shooting shipwrecked survivors as an example of a clearly illegal order that service members are obligated to refuse. \"For example, orders to fire upon the shipwrecked would be clearly illegal,\" the manual says on page 1117. Editor's note: This story has been updated with comments from Rep. Don Bacon and additional information from the Defense Department Law of War Manual.",

    "url": "https://www.axios.com/2025/11/30/christians-empathy-jesus-immigration-politics",
    "snippet_raw": "As the U.S. grows more diverse, a quiet civil war is unfolding within American Christianity over who deserves empathy. Why it matters: Conservatives ranging from evangelical pastors to Elon Musk have started framing empathy not as a virtue but as a vulnerability on immigration , racial justice and LGBTQ+ rights. They are working to drive out school lessons on empathy and argue in books and sermons that empathy is for the weak or \"woke.\" Others say empathy is central to Christianity and the teachings of Jesus. This split comes as Christianity and organized religion are shrinking and the U.S. undergoes a profound demographic transformation: no single racial group will hold a majority within two decades. Zoom in: \"Empathy as hoisted up as the highest virtue — or even a virtue at all — gets us into a really big mess,\" conservative author Allie Beth Stuckey said on a \"Family Talk\" podcast . She wrote a book last year, \" Toxic Empathy : How Progressives Exploit Christian Compassion.\" \"Empathy is dangerous. Empathy is toxic. Empathy will align you with hell,\" pastor Josh McPherson, a conservative men's-ministry influencer, said on his \"Stronger Man Nation\" podcast. Pastor Joe Rigney, in his book, \" The Sin of Empathy: Compassion and Its Counterfeits,\" attacks empathy as spiritually dangerous. Elon Musk said on Joe Rogan's podcast this February that Western empathy toward the suffering of others is being \"weaponized\" and linked it to civilizational decline, even though he thought empathy was good. The big picture: Around 80% of U.S. adults said empathy was a moral value that underpinned a healthy society, according to the wide-ranging survey by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) in October. Only 16% said empathy was a dangerous emotion that undermines \"our ability to set up a society that is guided by God's truth,\" the poll found. The other side: \"In the Christian tradition, to have anybody argue that a spirit of empathy is somehow a vulnerability... is insane,\" Father Brendan Busse, pastor of Dolores Mission Catholic Church in Los Angeles, tells Axios. Busse said the suffering of Jesus on the Cross invokes empathy, as does the call to help \"the least of these\" in the Gospels. Empathy drives the mission of Homeboy Industries, the Los Angeles-based (and world's largest) gang intervention organization, founded by Catholic priest Greg Boyle. The North Carolina-based Repairers of the Breach , founded by Bishop William J. Barber II, uses empathy to fight poverty and economic inequality. Between the lines : Between 2021 and early 2023, legislators in at least 25 states introduced bills backed by conservatives intended to ban or restrict social-emotional learning (SEL) in K-12 schools. Social-emotional learning is an educational strategy that teaches empathy, cooperation and social skills. All SEL bans have failed to pass following opposition from educators and moderate Christians. The bottom line: The Bible gives conflicting messages on empathy, said Dan McClellan, a Biblical scholar and author of \" The Bible Says So: What We Get Right (and Wrong) About Scripture's Most Controversial Issues.\" On the one hand, McClellan said some stories in scripture speak of empathy only for your ethnic group and disregard others, like Joshua's passages about the walls of Jericho and the killing of innocent children. \"Then there's a universal empathy, where your empathy extends beyond your own group,\" McClellan said, pointing to the Beatitudes and Jesus' parable about the Good Samaritan.",

    "title": "The retirement crisis is here",
    "url": "https://www.axios.com/2025/11/29/retirement-crisis-social-security-2026",
    "snippet_raw": "A silver tsunami is washing across our shores, as record numbers of Americans start hitting retirement age. The U.S. isn't ready. Why it matters: Older Americans are living longer than any previous generation and stepping into an unfamiliar, less secure version of retirement. Many of them haven't caught up to this new reality, and neither have policymakers. About 45% of Americans will experience retirement-funding shortfalls if they retire at 65, according to Morningstar's projections from last year. The full retirement age , which has gradually increased, is now steady at 67. The big picture: Retirees on fixed incomes face an ever-rising cost of living. Out-of-pocket medical expenses are escalating, the cost of in-home care is growing more than three times faster than inflation, and an increasing share of the elderly are spending more than a third of their income on real estate too. By the numbers: Pensions once provided retirees with a regular, expected source of income for as long as they lived. They were a boon for the Silent Generation and older boomers. Now they are vanishing. Only about 14% of Generation X (those ages 45-60) have a pension plan, according to the National Institute on Retirement Security . \"We kind of took care of the Greatest Generation,\" Teresa Ghilarducci, an economist at the New School for Social Research and leading retirement researcher, tells Axios. But the younger generations have had much less support. On paper, retirement accounts might make older Americans appear wealthy. There are an increasing number of 401(k) millionaires , after all. But with costs and debts rising — and lifespans lengthening — older Americans might run out of money, she says, or be forced to severely cut back spending. \"We have shades of the retirement crisis right now.\" Between the lines: There's massive inequality when it comes to retirement readiness — workers earning more than $150,000 a year contribute nearly 13 times more toward retirement than those earning under $50,000, a report out in November found. It's easy to say that many elderly people will simply work longer, but that's not always possible. Threat level: There are steps people can take to get on track for retirement, but the question looming over everything is whether future retirees will get full Social Security benefits — not a sure thing, as Axios' Kelly Tyko reports. About 56 million Americans age 65 and older receive Social Security benefits, per federal data . The lowest-earning workers rely on it. Social Security is the primary source of income for retirees with household incomes below $50,000, according to Transamerica 's 2025 retirement survey. \"A cut of 20% to 25% in Social Security benefits would have a devastating impact on retirees who rely heavily or solely on those payments,\" said Kristi Martin Rodriguez, who leads the Nationwide Retirement Institute . \"61% of current recipients say missing even half of a payment would leave them unable to survive financially.\" Reality check: Experts have been warning about a retirement crisis for decades, and we have yet to see one, Andrew Biggs, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, tells Axios. \"The real retirement crisis is on the governmental side,\" he says, pointing to the Social Security funding gaps, which are just a few years away. People delaying retirement as long as possible could help address these gaps. The bottom line: The future of retirement in the U.S. looks murky.",

    "snippet_raw": "A top Food and Drug Administration regulator called for tighter government vaccine oversight, including stricter guidelines for the annual flu shot and new vaccines, after an internal agency review linked COVID-19 vaccines to the deaths of 10 children. Why it matters: The findings, which were announced in an internal FDA memo and haven't been published in a medical journal, signal another likely shake-up in vaccine policy . This one would extend beyond COVID shots and require more rigorous evidence to approve flu immunizations, inoculations for pregnant women and the practice of administering multiple vaccines. The big picture: The memo from top vaccine regulator Vinay Prasad comes ahead of a key meeting of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked vaccine advisors next week that will take up a prospective overhaul of the childhood vaccine schedule . Kennedy's department has already dropped a broad recommendation that Americans get COVID shots, signaling an official lack of confidence in the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. Driving the news: Prasad's emailed memo, a copy of which was reviewed by Axios, said no fewer than 10 children's deaths were linked to the vaccines, based on an intial review of 96 deaths between 2021 and 2024 reported to the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. Prasad called the findings a \"profound revelation\" and called for swift action, including \"pre-market randomized trials assessing clinical endpoints for most new products.\" What's inside: The FDA will impose tougher standards for authorizing vaccines for pregnant women, and pneumonia vaccine makers will have to show their products reduce pneumonia (at least in the post-market setting) and don't merely generate antibodies, Prasad wrote. \"For the first time, the U.S. F.D.A. will acknowledge that COVID-19 vaccines have killed American children,\" his memo stated. The email didn't cite the type of COVID vaccines involved or other key details, including how the agency established the link. The vaccine reporting system is a repository of reports of adverse reactions from a wide variety of sources. It isn't designed to assign a cause. Prasad has long been critical of the vaccines and the federal pandemic response. Earlier this year, he abruptly left the agency amid rumored tensions with the White House but was reinstated less than two weeks later with the backing of Kennedy and FDA commissioner Marty Makary. In the memo, Prasad states he's \"open to vigorous discussions and debate on vaccine policies ... until they are ready to be made public.\" He instructed staff members within the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research who don't agree with these core principles to submit their resignations. The Department of Health and Human Services didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Between the lines: The memo's findings, first reported by the New York Times, suggests the children's deaths were connected to myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle — a known, but rare, side effect linked to the vaccines since early in the pandemic. In 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded there was a \"likely association,\" especially in adolescents and young adults, but that there still was a benefit for the group to get the shot. Earlier this year, the FDA ordered Pfizer and Moderna to expand warnings on the labels of their COVID-19 vaccines for the risk of heart inflammation in adolescents and young men. The agency cited updated estimates of cases and a post-approval study showing the persistence of heart problems months after getting the mRNA shots. Yes, but: Infectious disease doctors and health researchers insist that COVID vaccines remain safe and effective and have saved many lives, pointing to scores of peer-reviewed scientific articles and controlled trials. They've argued there is no scientific evidence to justify Kennedy's decisions to drop recommendations for the shots, and some accuse the administration of cherry-picking data to arrive at a pre-determined conclusion. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told the New York Times the memo was an example of science \"by press release.\"",

    "snippet_raw": "Cigarettes were once unavoidable in the U.S., in restaurants, airplanes, your mom's living room — until health warnings and cultural pressure put out the hype. The big picture : Something's shifted. Young people are talking up smoking again, and celebrities are casually lighting up on screen. Experts worry that they're not paying attention to the dangers of addiction . Films and TV shows are bringing cigarettes back as props, too, making them en vogue once again. More than half of the top box-office films released in 2024 featured tobacco imagery — marking a 10 percentage point jump from the year before, according to a report from public health nonprofit Truth Initiative and NORC at the University of Chicago You'd be hard-pressed to miss cigarettes across pop culture. Dakota Johnson lights up in the dramedy \"The Materialists.\" The chefs on \"The Bear\" smoke regularly, with season 3 featuring Carmy's efforts to quit. Sabrina Carpenter takes a puff a cigarette with a fork in her \"Manchild\" music video. The Instagram account Cigfluencers posts old and new photos of celebs — including Charli xcx, Natalie Portman and Leo DiCaprio — taking drags. Zoom out: Across social media , smokers and non-smokers have pointed out the abundance of people lighting up, too. \"I have one cigarette a day,\" said Chloe Richman, host of the \"all body no brains\" podcast in an August episode. \"I smoke the skinny ones, so it's like barely anything.\" \"I truly think smoking a cigarette is one of the coolest things a person can do,\" said one TikTok user in a video with 33,000 views. \"I wish I wasn't such a baby so I could take it up as a full-time habit.\" What they're saying: \"Every few years, we see headlines claiming that smoking is becoming popular again,\" Ranjana Caple, director of federal advocacy at the American Lung Association, told Axios. \"It's not new to make smoking look cool,\" she added. \"Big Tobacco spent decades perfecting that playbook. Today's moment is a modern remix of an old strategy, and it hides the reality that cigarettes are designed to addict and kill.\" Reality check: Cigarettes are still a major public health concern, and fewer people are smoking every year. Per the CDC , 16 million Americans live with a smoking-related disease. Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of disease, death and disability nationwide, according to the CDC, with more than 480,000 people dying every year from smoking and secondhand smoke. Zoom out: The return of cigarettes may not be about that nicotine as much as it is about young people's recent obsession with nostalgia. Young people have started using analog bags — which contain physical devices like magazines and crossword puzzles — to pry their eyes away from phones. They've also embraced the fashion trends of the Y2K era ( mostly without the doomsday fears) and the Ralph Lauren Christmas decor that taps into the romanticism of their childhoods.

    "url": "https://www.axios.com/2025/11/29/funding-cuts-erasing-black-history-blackout-report",
    "snippet_raw": "In the past year, federal, state and institutional decisions have gutted major pillars of America's civil rights protections and racial equity infrastructure, wiping away public data, slashing research funding and erasing Black history. Why it matters: Taken together, these moves amount to an unprecedented rollback of civil rights progress, historians say — the largest since Reconstruction. Zoom in: Effects are piling up. $3.4 billion in grants for HBCUs, public health research and Black entrepreneurs have been cut or frozen, according to the Blackout Report , from the nonprofit Onyx Impact. 6,769 federal datasets have been deleted, including those tracking maternal mortality and sickle cell disease , which disproportionately affect Black Americans, per the Blackout report. Also removed: data on workforce diversity and environmental exposure in historically redlined neighborhoods — information that directly informs racial equity policy. 591 books by Black authors have been banned from Pentagon-run schools and libraries, Onyx Impact notes. The removed titles include works by Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou and Ibram X. Kendi. The Trump administration is reviewing national museums, including the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History & Culture, after President Trump criticized the museums as being \"out of control\" and focusing on \"how horrible our country is.\" Government websites have deleted content related to Black history. Some deleted material — including National Park Service pages about Harriet Tubman and Medgar Evers — was restored after public backlash, but researchers say most erasures remain uncorrected. The unemployment rate for Black women has risen sharply to 7.5%, according to the most recent government data . That's significantly higher than the overall unemployment rate, and is partly a result of Trump's cuts to the federal workforce, which have disproportionately hit Black women, Axios' Emily Peck reports . A backlash in the diversity, equity and inclusion space has also hit this group. Colleges across the country have shuttered cultural centers, including those that are geared toward Black students, The Washington Post reports . \"When datasets or historical materials disappear, it becomes harder to see, and fix, racial disparities,\" says Maya Wiley, who leads the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. \"We've seen rollbacks before, after Reconstruction, after the civil-rights movement. And every time, they were justified with new language and new fears. ... The terms change. The strategy doesn't.\" A White House official told Axios that the administration is focused on \"restoring the Gold Standard of Science — not ideological activism\" and on removing \"divisive DEI initiatives\" to promote merit-based hiring. The administration pointed to earlier initiatives from Trump's first term — including permanent HBCU funding , Opportunity Zones and the First Step Act criminal justice reform legislation — as evidence of the administration's record on Black economic progress. What we're watching: The cuts and deletions are, paradoxically, drawing more attention to Black history, says National Urban League president Marc H. Morial. \"The attempt to erase history has made all of us more cognizant of the need to tell it,\" he said. Go deeper: Trump rolls back DEI programs for federal workers",

    "snippet_raw": "MAGA hopes the holiday season — and renewed attention on its favorite bogeymen — can produce a ceasefire in the pro-Trump movement's burgeoning civil war . Why it matters: MAGA entered the year at the apex of its power, but has become mired in its most bitter infighting since its founding by President Trump in 2015. If the base can unite during the holidays against its perceived enemies — Democratic lawmakers branded \" the seditious six ,\" former FBI Director James Comey , the media — it might help the right turn a painful page. If not, the turmoil could become a systemic problem that plagues MAGA through the midterms. What they're saying: Some Republicans have been pleading for weeks for an armistice in the infighting, trying but failing to shift the spotlight to a supposedly dangerous left. \"Let these debates play out, but don't let these debates that we're having internally blind us to the fact that we are up against a radical leftist movement,\" Vice President Vance said at an event with Breitbart News last week. \"The future is a choice between grievance populism ... or conservative, nationalist populism (MAGA). One ends in bloody, socialist upheaval and poverty, the other in national renewal. If you focus on domestic policy, you win,\" Turning Point USA's Andrew Kolvet said in late October. Driving the news: This week's headlines featured many of MAGA's top enemies. Immigrants and Islam: The shooting of two National Guard troops in Washington by an Afghan refugee reignited fury over immigration enforcement during the Biden administration, especially after the Afghan government collapsed in 2021. Trump on Wednesday suspended all immigration applications from Afghan nationals with immediate effect The \"deep state\": A judge's dismissal of charges against Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James renewed outrage against supposed liberal saboteurs within the federal bureaucracy and judiciary. Imprisonment and impeachment are the cures, according to MAGA. The \"seditious six\": A video of six Democratic lawmakers urging servicemembers to refuse illegal orders set off accusations of subversion and insurrection. Influencers are urging Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to return Sen. Mark Kelly (R-Ariz.) — a retired Navy officer — to active duty to be court martialed. The media: MAGA blasted MS Now and Bloomberg News over respective reports suggesting Trump was souring on FBI Director Kash Pate l, and that envoy Steve Witkoff had advised Russian officials on how to pitch Trump on a Ukraine peace proposal. \"The media is lying in order to derail the president's agenda. It's really that simple,\" Vance tweeted in response to reporting about rifts in the administration's Ukraine policy. Repeat offenders: The burning of a woman on a Chicago train by an alleged attacker with a lengthy rap sheet drew right-wing fury at supposedly \"woke\" criminal sentencing guidelines and judges. Catch up quick: These headlines offered a brief reprieve from the ongoing MAGA civil war, which has erupted across multiple fronts. Israel and antisemitism: Debates over aid to Israel and definitions of antisemitism widened into questions about who belongs under the MAGA tent — a fight that exploded after Tucker Carlson interviewed Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes . Jeffrey Epstein: MAGA has demanded transparency around the 2019 prison death of the late financier and convicted sex trafficker. Trump ultimately succumbed to the pressure by blessing legislation to pass, but he also turned on Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) over her criticism of his handling of the issue — driving her to resign. Foreign focus: After GOP losses in New Jersey and Virginia, MAGA demanded a renewed focus on \"affordability.\" But Trump rolled out the red carpet for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for a summit and said he'd try to halt fighting in Sudan at the Gulf monarch's request. Immigration: Trump's advocacy for H-1B visas for high-skilled foreign workers has inserted a wedge between him and his base, which believes U.S. workers have all the talent the American economy needs. Yes, but: The shift in the spotlight doesn't mean the fights aren't continuing under the surface. Fuentes continued attacking \"foreign interlopers who only care about Israel,\" and conservative influencer Brandon Tatum still knocked Carlson for interviewing Fuentes.",

    "snippet_raw": "President Trump has escalated his attacks on female reporters in recent weeks, calling them everything from \"stupid,\" \" ugly \" and \"piggy.\" Why it matters: Press freedom groups have condemned his verbal escalations, calling his rhetoric an \"unmistakable pattern of hostility.\" Driving the news: The president on Thursday asked longtime CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes \"Are you stupid?\" after she asked him about the suspect involved in the shooting of two National Guard members earlier this week. Last Monday at a different press conference in Washington, the president berated ABC News chief White House correspondent Mary Bruce during an Oval Office press conference. She had asked Saudi Arabia's crown prince about the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which a United Nations report and U.S. intelligence determined was carried out at his direction. \"You don't have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that,\" he said, while calling her a \"terrible reporter. He called her question \"horrible,\" \"insubordinate,\" and \"terrible.\" Days earlier, the president told a Bloomberg reporter, \"quiet, piggy\" as she asked him about the Epstein files during a press gaggle. Between the lines: President Trump has a history of lashing out at female reporters, but the attacks have escalated during his second term. During a CNN town hall in 2023, the president called CNN moderator Kaitlan Collins a \"nasty person.\" In March 2020, he told PBS journalist Yamiche Alcindor during a COVID-19 press briefing, \"Be nice, don't be threatening.\" He said her \"threatening\" line of questioning is \"why you used to work for the Times and now you work for someone else.\" He also spoke down to CBS White House correspondent Weijia Jiang at a later pandemic briefing, telling her to \"keep your voice down\" while she was questioning the president about his COVID-19 response. The other side: White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement, \"President Trump has never been politically correct, never holds back, and in large part, the American people re-elected him for his transparency.\" \"This has nothing to do with gender – it has everything to do with the fact that the President's and the public's trust in the media is at all time lows.\" Zoom out: Press freedom groups have long alleged that the president's disparaging rhetoric against journalists contributes to a broader decline in press freedoms in the U.S. by creating an environment of hostility and intimidation. Following the comments made to Bruce earlier this month, the Society of Professional Journalists said, \"These incidents are not isolated; they are part of an unmistakable pattern of hostility — often directed at women — that undermines the essential role of a free and independent press.\"",
